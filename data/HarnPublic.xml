        Noble by birth, with some noble skills (such as literacy),
        he is essentially a guildsman (timberwright) with
        delusions of glory. Years of hate and fear have left him
        gaunt, haggard and looking much older than his twentyseven
        years of age. He has brown eyes and dark brown
        hair. Although he tries to project a cheerful demeanour,
        he is slightly paranoid and cheap with his money. He is
        well dressed (preferring maroon) but over-accessorized,
        showing his desperate desire to be accepted as one of the
        gentle folk. Despite his attempts to fit in, he tends to
        be shuffled aside in conversations.

        A broker for the timberwright's guild, Naviel is a
        follower. Reasonably intelligent, he hates to make
        decisions and prefers to defer to others. He is of average
        size, with a slim build, green eyes and brown hair. He
        wears good clothes that always seem a little baggy on him
        as if they were hand-me-downs. Naviel has no tact and
        bluntly says whatever comes to mind. For the last five
        years, he has acted as Akitt's agent, finding buyers for
        the timber and investing his profits. He has an extensive
        array of shady and illegal contacts throughout the
        kingdom. He keeps one penny in seven of Akitt's ill-gotten
        gains.

        The second son of Akitt's mother's brother, Lynd has
        always worked hard and led an active outdoor life. He is
        extremely fit, looking somewhat younger than his 34
        years. His blue eyes are a striking contrast to his jet
        black hair and make him stand out in a crowd. He is cocky
        and proud of his body, wearing tight leather pants and a
        leather jerkin which emphasize his physique. Lynd is a
        darling with the ladies. Although intelligent, he talks
        quite slowly, appearing to pause and carefully consider
        every word. Lynd is definitely more capable than his
        cousin, but fate granted the manor to Akitt. Lynd stays
        for the easy money.

        Akitt's two guards are thugs and bullies. Despite being
        relatively lazy, they are both strong, intimidating
        men. Kenric is tall with brown eyes and hair. He is the
        leader of the two and makes most of the decisions. His
        priorities are his own safety, money, women and comfort,
        in that order. Hedin is medium height with brown eyes and
        dirty blond hair. He makes his wishes known but generally
        follows Kenric's lead. Hedin likes to hurt people,
        especially women. He raped several women in the village
        and enjoys roughing up prostitutes. As long as there is a
        steady flow of beer and women he is happy anywhere.

        A slight, athletic, middle-aged man with a hook nose and
        slight accent, he adeptly masterminds and directs the
        gang's criminal activities while remaining safely and
        discreetly in the shadows. Known in Lia-Kavair circles as
        "The Tutor", Firan recruits children and trains them as
        highly effective pursecutters and cat burglars. He gives
        them training, food, shelter, and protection in return for
        all of the goods they can steal. Firan pays the Lia-
        Kavair guildmaster, Halime of Falesh [Tashal H16], one
        third of the goods in guild fees and must fence the stolen
        goods through Kirlin of Pasena [Tashal F29]. Perla of
        Rabeta [Tashal E7] secretly "owns" the gang's hideout
        [Eastside City Block 13] in addition to her three publicly
        owned tenements.  Careful bribes ensure that it does not
        actually appear anywhere on the city's tax rolls. Firan
        pays her one third of his gang's take in rent.

        One of Firan's former pupils, he is Firan's brutal ally
        and enforcer. Just 23 years old, his mean steak is
        notorious. His seventeen-year-old girlfriend, Nyce, is one
        of Perla's prostitutes. Brulin's dog, Bull's-eye, is as
        vicious as his master and trusty companion. Brulin
        occasionally does "special jobs" for Perla.

        Other gang members: Coryn is always ready to laugh at
        anything. Nobwig is an overgrown, cowardly bully. Chitling
        is a rather dim member of the gang who was flogged after
        being caught doing Firan's bidding. Pint is nicknamed for
        his fondness for ale. Yoreth, Laen, Kalas, Danil and Avin
        are just a few of the other members of the gang. At any
        one time, there are from twelve to as many as twenty
        'Ferrets', ranging in age from as young as nine to
        eighteen. As they get older, most gang members join the
        adult Lia-Kavair.

        Felipe is a rather infamous member of the gang. Fifteen,
        he has been caught and escaped custody several times. He
        can dislocate his shoulders to fit through unbelievably
        small openings. He has a strange habit of talking to Peoni
        as if she were present.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Originally from Hibut, in the Thardic Republic, Petin has
        worked as a mercenary for most of his adult life. After
        completing his obligatory four years of service, he was
        &quot;invited&quot; to leave and not return. Although not
        an alcoholic, his fondness for ale and good food and
        overly relaxed attitude to the whole work-and-duty thing
        made him a slovenly soldier. Only his massive strength and
        quick reflexes saved him from being killed over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 715, Andel Gebar, Permanent Secretary to the Chief
        Clerk of the Exchequer, retained Petin as a personal
        bodyguard. The pay is low, but the hours are good, there
        is plenty of food and the threat is limited. Over the
        ensuing five years, Petin has let himself &quot;relaxquot;
        even more and enjoy life. He rarely wears his quilt or
        leather armor anymore, he finds them excessively hot and
        tight. His shield and shortsword can most often be found
        tied to the back of one of the mules. Despite this lax
        attitude, Petin is still a deadly opponent as several
        brigands and ruffians have discovered. For a large man, he
        can move quickly over short distances and there is nothing
        wrong with his combat skills. More than one opponent has
        found themselves disarmed, knocked off their feet and with
        his spear point at their throat before they could even
        react.
      </p>
      <p>
        Petin is content with his job. He doesn't particularly like
        or dislike Andel, he is just a paymaster. He and Kernt (his
        fellow bodyguard) get on well and could seek out more
        lucrative jobs, but they both know it doesn't get much
        cushier than this. He is much more protective of Dramin and,
        especially, Riatha (the cook). They take good care of him

      <p>
        The fourth son of a minor Melderyni knight, there was no
        land for him, so at age twelve he was put into the Peonian
        Church School at Cherafir. His father's cousin, the Avasana
        (Master of Archives), eased his entry into the school. He
        spent five years there. When he was young, he suffered an
        abscess of the spine. It healed but left him slightly
        stooped and twisted, the object of scorn and ridicule by his
        classmates. However, he survived and the abuse strengthened
        his resolve. He excelled at his scripts, perhaps a
        compensation for his physical defects. His penmanship earned
        him the praise of even his strictest tutors. Toris had no
        particular interest in theology, liturgy or pastoral care,
        but had a strong liking for books and manuscripts and an
        insatiable curiosity about other people's business, probably
        because his was so dull.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, Toris became an Ebasethe (Priest) at the
        temple. Gradually, over the next decade, he became a
        workhorse in the administration of the temple. He was
        employed mainly in the Archives and his participation in the
        religious life of the church was confined to the obligatory
        attendance of the regular services. One of his additional
        tasks was teaching reading and writing, which eventually led
        to his downfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his physical deformity, Toris likes women and has a
        normal sex drive. In 715TR, he was accused of raping one of
        his students, a fourteen-year-old girl. He was innocent, but
        her father was relentless. Toris was thrown out of the
        church and the job he loved. Everywhere he went gossip and
        rumor followed him. Finally, he made his way, half-starved,
        to Thay, where he threw himself on the mercy of his father's
        cousin (now a High Priest). The man prevailed on his old
        friend, Sir Jorn Stury, recently appointed Royal Agent, to
        take on Toris as his clerk. He agreed and so, with no money
        or other prospects, Toris has been tramping around the
        countryside after Sir Jorn and Gwyn working as scribe and
        spy.

      <p>
        Parma, as the crew knows him, is a cleric (such as there
        are) of Siem. He is a pure blooded Jarin from Arathel,
        with a dark complexion and curly grey hair. He most
        recently hales from a Taur-Im-Aina (Holy Grove) on the
        &quot;South Downs&quot; of Evael. Parma seems to be
        suffering a great deal of inner torment, showing signs of
        moral weakness, while at the same time teaching a higher
        standard. A cleric, he's the older and wiser member of
        Lorkin's crew. While he has found Siem, he's not sure if
        he's found himself. He wants to see the world again and
        spread hope. He's well educated and spends a lot of
        leisure time with Inara... just to talk, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is much more to Parma's history than he lets on. In
        673TR, Jurri Canjarl led five warboats against Arathel. The
        island fell without a fight after Brela Merovyne challenged
        Jurri Canjarl to personal combat and was slain. Jurri
        married Brela's sister, Thiana. His son, Tursi, became
        Valhakar in 692. In 693TR, Tursi united Clan Canjarl and
        Clan Merovyne as one, adopting the clan name Cyeen. Derrial
        is Tursi's mother's younger brother. In accordance with his
        elder brother Brela's wishes, he did not resist the Ivinians
        and swore an oath of allegiance to Jurri, then Tursi, making
        him a traitor in the eyes of many Jarin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parma is a devout follower of Siem and a member of the
        Uthriem Roliri from birth. As a relative of the Valhakar,
        he acted as emissary and agent, especially in dealings
        with the Jarin clans of Arathel and the Jarin lords of
        Leriel, Gwaeryn and Pethwys. During the Jarin Rebellion,
        to keep the peace in Arathel and save lives, he used his
        skills and training to spy on several key rebel leaders,
        at great cost to his own soul. After the rebellion ended,
        he left his nephew's service to make a pilgrimage to Evael
        to repent and beg forgiveness for betraying his own
        blood. The elves stopped him on their borders and threaten
        to take away his memories, he replied, &quot;I wish you
        would!&quot; They allowed him to enter and he spent many
        years in prayer and meditation in the Holy Groves, finding
        some measure of forgiveness, peace and contentment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 719TR, he was summoned; rumours of the Crimson Dancer's
        &quot;human experiments&quot; had reached King Aranath. Through one of
        their agents, the Council of Eleven had learned that one
        girl, Kibâ Tam, had been rescued and was on her way to
        Cherafir. The King asked Parma to come out of retirement,
        watch over her and, if possible, determine what had been
        done to the girl. Parma boarded the Lorkin in
        Cherafir. Although he has tried to renounce violence, he
        occasionally surprises the crew with impressive combat
        skills. He bears a secret warrant, from the King of Evael,
        and could, as a last resort, identify himself as the uncle
        of the Valhakar of Clan Cyeen.
      </p>
      <p>
        He can draw weapons and armor from arms locker, but only if
        combat is expected.

      Parma sends regular coded reports
      to Evael through various agents in different ports. Lately,
      because of the Lorkin's schedule, he has not been able to
      file a report. He approaches the PCs to transport a simple
      letter to his cousin in Cherafir. They are going that way
      anyway.  Agents of the Agrikan church try to intercept the
      letter and kill the PCs.

        Inara Serra is a courtesan from Trierzon and enjoys high
        social standing, certainly higher than a ship full of petty
        crooks. Her motives and reasons for choosing to travel on
        the Lorkin remain a mystery and not even Captain Ranals
        knows what a high-class escort is doing on a low-class ship
        like his. She claims to be working towards retirement and
        her choice of wealthy and decent clientele seems to support
        that assertion. Inara services women as well as men and
        always chooses her clients carefully. She has traveled
        widely, including Chelemby and Harbaal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the most respectable person aboard Lorkin, Inara is the
        picture of beauty, elegance and refinement in their most
        positive aspects. Sophisticated, intelligent and educated,
        she and Shâ have a mutual love-hate relationship, with
        unspoken sexual tension playing a part of their daily
        lives. The fact that she is a courtesan seems to distress
        Shâ a great deal. He conceals his feelings by being rude
        to her (and other people) about it. Shâ has been known to
        introduce her as a whore. The crews' nickname for her is
        &quot;The Ambassador.&quot; Part of her contract with Shâ
        is that she will not service him or anyone in his employ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inara holds sway over the Captain in part because of her
        position as a paying traveler (she has her own cabin,
        stylishly decorated as her boudoir) and in part as the woman
        that currently holds his heart. Her poise and confidence
        also gives her power when dealing with the crew. She is not
        haughty, nor does she put on airs that she is above everyone
        else. For the most part, she remains apolitical, offering
        friendship to everyone, and advice in times of need. Since
        leaving Trierzon over two years ago, she has adapted quite
        well to the wild border regions... she even owns a
        dagger.

      courtesan. She takes a fancy to one of the PCs and agrees to
      a night of lovemaking (for a price). The next day, Captain
      Ranals is not pleased. He may punch them out or challenge
      them to a duel for some imagined fault.

      <p>
        Lläwaûr Tam is a surgeon and physician of the first
        calibre. Born in Beleka, Seldenbaal, he is the son of a
        wealthy and successful guildsman. At 16, he was apprenticed
        to a renowned Azeryani surgeon-physician living in
        Beleka. He excelled at his studies, completing his training
        in just five years. By the age of 21, he had established his
        own practice in Beleka and was developing an enviable
        reputation as the best physician in Seldenbaal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As brilliant as he was, Lläwaûr was overshadowed by the
        intellect of his sister, Kibâ. When she was offered
        special training at a private woman's school run by the
        Order of the Crimson Dancer, he was overjoyed for her. At
        first he received occasional letters, then they dwindled
        and stopped altogether. Early in 719TR, Lläwaûr began to
        have dreams and &quot;voices in his head&quot; from his
        sister. &quot;They&quot; were hurting her. He tried to
        tell his parents but no one believed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Lläwaûr traveled to Zuden, Orbaal, alone. Staying
        with distant kin, he began to make enquires about the
        Crimson Dancer. His clansmen warned him it was death to
        visit Quimen uninvited. Then, men claiming to be members of
        the Jarin Resistance (Cheyn Mhic Cainte) covertly approach
        him. They offered to rescue his sister in return for a
        massive sum. He paid. Several days later, they delivered
        Kibâ to him, drugged and hidden in a chest. He snuck her
        aboard a ship bound for Cherafir. There, Kibâ still hidden,
        they transferred to the Lorkin. Lläwaûr expended most of his
        resources to get her out of the Crimson Dancer's clutches
        and is fiercely protective of her. She has been `damaged' by
        the Agrikans and he is the only one who can calm her when
        she suffers one of her many delusions or psychotic
        episodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A young, attractive and skilled physician, Lläwaûr is
        socially inept. His bumbling attempts to start a
        relationship with Kayly are a source of amusement for the
        crew and frustration for her. He has recently displayed a
        previously unknown skill for planning capers. This has
        allowed him to fit in better and even Eryla gives him some
        respect. Because of his Ivinian upbringing, he often
        disagrees with the Captain over the Jarin Rebellion. Lläwaûr
        is always very well dressed and speaks with a noticeable
        accent.

      <p>
        Hoban Fiôrfohd (Fiôr for short) hails from Kolorn in
        landlocked Kaldor. As a child, growing up, he had a strange
        affinity for water and would often `mess about in boats' on
        the Kald River. He was an excellent fisherman, supplementing
        his family's diet with his catch. However, there was always
        something missing in his life. Then one day, he met a
        merchant friend of his father. The man described his many
        travels about huge ocean going ships. Fiôr was entranced. He
        had to see the sea. The youngest son of a woodcrafter, he
        had little hope of ever being more than a journeyman to his
        older brother and he couldn't get the dreams of the sea out
        of his mind. So, at eighteen he took his family's leave and
        headed south to Melderyn and the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working odd jobs, Fiôr made his way to Thay where he found
        employment as a seaman. He took to the sea `like a duck to
        water'. He quickly made ordinary seaman, where a sympathetic
        pilot spotted his skill and took him on as his
        apprentice. He served nine years with three different
        pilots, quickly outstripping all of them and passing his
        exams with ease. A natural pilot, he was rarely short of
        work, however he wanted more. He found it in the form of a
        shady Jarin captain named Shâ and his stunning first mate,
        Zoë. Fiôr came with a list of references as long as his leg,
        but found a home on the Lorkin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Married in 715TR, Fiôr is Zoë's amusingly insecure
        husband. He is charming and romantic. Zoë loves him dearly,
        but Fiôr worries she may still have feelings for the Captain
        and is jealous of their shared history and shorthand
        banter. He doesn't like the way Zoë tends to blindly (in his
        opinion) follow the Captain's orders. Unassuming and
        self-deprecating, he is pretty far from the fiery hero
        type. Instead, he is laid back and calm (once he was
        laconic) with a great sense of humour.
      </p>
      <p>
        He can draw weapons and armor from arms locker, but only if
        combat is expected.

      The PCs need to get somewhere

      <p>
        Kayly is the ship's carpenter.  Born in Sarkum, Kanday, she
        is a shipwright's daughter. A tomboy, she spent her
        adolescence in his shipyard. Although he never intended for
        her to become an apprentice, she shadowed him constantly,
        picking up the necessary skills with supernatural
        ease. Originally, Shâ had hired another chippy (a cocky,
        tattooed fellow by the name of Bester). When the Captain
        caught him screwing Kayly, instead of finding a leak like he
        was supposed to be doing, he made some excuse about not
        being able to find the problem. She pointed out the loose
        caulking and fixed it easily. Shâ fired Bester and hired
        her on the spot. With her stunned parents approval, and a
        rushed enrolment into the guild as a journeyman (being the
        daughter of the resident master helped), Kayly set sail
        aboard the Lorkin. Despite the fact that she had never left
        home before joining the Lorkin, Kayly loves the adventure
        and prefers life aboard `her' ship to any port.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite her lack of formal training, she has an intuitive
        sense for how to fix ships. It is only her exceptional
        mechanical aptitude that keeps the Lorkin sailing. Kayly
        does not want to let the Captain down, and so does her best
        to keep the ship running smoothly, despite the desperate
        requirement for a refit and constant shortage of spares. As
        a result, she's extremely sensitive to insults (or even
        candid observations) about the ship's appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young, sexy, sweet, chipper and relentlessly cheery, Kayly
        is the type of person who maintains a bright attitude even
        when others are feeling low. She loves life, the crew, and
        is fiercely protective of the Lorkin, though she doesn't
        have a violent bone in her body and shrinks from
        confrontation. She carries no weapons and always appears a
        bit dishevelled, having just come from tarring the hull or
        fixing a broken spar. However, her innate, primal, sexuality
        shows through the male clothing, dirt and grime. She has a
        romantic attraction (so far unrequited) for the ship's
        physician, Lläwaûr Tam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affinity/Wood is a unique psionic Talent (Lado +1). The
        invoker can &quot;talk&quot; to a wooden object (like a
        ship), allowing them to detect strengths, weakness,
        tension and pressure before they can become a
        problem. This also allows them to intuitively shape wood
        so as to maximize its strength.

      <p>
        Born in Seldenbaal, the daughter of a wealthy guildsman,
        Kibâ is a genius and child prodigy. Agents of the Agrikan
        Order of the Crimson Dancers detected her extraordinary aura
        at the age of thirteen. Already surpassing the best tutors
        her parents could find, she was ecstatic when the Agrikans
        approached her parents and invited her to attend their
        special school. It offered the most spectacular, challenging
        program and the opportunity to study with great
        teachers. She left Beleka in 716TR, bound for the Order's
        headquarters in Orbaal.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, she wrote her beloved brother often. Then, the
        letters slowed and finally ceased. In 719TR, Lläwaûr began
        to have vivid and disturbing dreams and visions. `They' were
        hurting her. He tried to convince his parents that she was
        in danger, but they refused to believe him. It was true, the
        Order was `experimenting' on her at a secret hunting lodge
        in the mountains above Quimen. Lläwaûr travelled to Orbaal
        and, with the assistance of some sympathisers, was able to
        rescue her. Since that time, they have been on the run. The
        Agrikans are eager to recapture her and have posted a
        substantial reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Borderline psychotic and almost impossible to communicate
        with (a result of the experiments), Kibâ is still undeniably
        brilliant. Now, she can read minds and has a tendency to
        blurt out not only what is on her own mind, but those of
        everyone around her. Kibâ has some amazing skills, though
        she displays them only sporadically, and usually without
        conscious thought. Based on her demonstrated abilities,
        Lläwaûr thinks they may have been trying to turn her into
        some sort of assassin. She has repressed most of the
        memories of her time in the Academy, so she has been unable
        to help explain what happened to her. She does have several
        scars on her scalp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brother and sister boarded the Lorkin in
        Cherafir. Captain Ranals hates the Ivinians with a passion
        and suffers an inconvenient sense of charity. He also needed
        a doctor and Lläwaûr is `not weak.' As a result, he has
        allowed them to stay, so long as Lläwaûr keeps Kibâ under
        control. The doctor has been experimenting with different
        drugs and potions to try and stabilize Kibâ's condition, so
        far with varying degrees of success.

        Gwyn was born forty-two years ago, to a tin miner from Vimen
        Hundred who had turned to fishing and moved to Parnam Keep
        on the coast of Melderyn. Gwyn followed the fishing trade
        until he was seventeen, then moved to Thay to become a
        slaughterman in the market. His huge size brought him an
        invitation to become a bodyguard-cum-squire to a local
        knight. It was fifteen years ago, in 705TR, when he was
        accepted into Sir Jorn's service. He has served him ever
        since. They fought against Ivinians during the Rape of Thay
        and then made a great pilgrimage to Tengela, Trierzon, where
        they joined a huge Laranian army fighting against the
        Azeryan Empire. Their extensive travels make them objects of
        fascination and great respect among the commoners. Their
        vast combat experience and knowledge of the many ways a
        person may die make them natural investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
        After they returned from Trierzon, Sir Jorn, a fiercely
        loyal subject of the King, was offered a position as a
        Royal Agent, part of the King's government working for the
        Inquisitor-General. He accepted, and was given broad
        powers to investigate &quot;matters of interest to the
        crown.&quot; Gwyn serves as Sir Jorn's unofficial deputy
        and faithful henchman, as well as companion and
        friend. This gingerhaired and mustachioed Lenedshire-man
        is taller and more massive than his master and has a
        booming voice when required. Though built like a bull, he
        can move fast over short distances. His huge body requires
        refueling at frequent intervals, so he keeps a stock of
        sausages, bread, cheese and beer handy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he enjoyed his adventures, Gwyn was happy to come
        home to Melderyn. He now lives in a small house in Thay with
        his wife and two boys. He is often gone for extended periods
        with his master, but he is well paid and his family lives
        comfortably.

      <p>
        Full-blooded Jarin, Eshârel Ranals (Shâ for short) was born
        in Arone. He never knew his father, who died when he was
        young. His mother, a successful cattle herder, raised him
        alone. In 700TR, while Shâ was out tending cattle, the Jarin
        rebels raided Arone, killing two huscarls. In retribution,
        the Ivinians hung twenty Jarin peasants, including Shâ's
        mother. Nursing a burning desire for revenge, Shâ fled into
        the wilderness and joined the rebels. There, he met Zoë,
        beginning a life long friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shâ rose quickly among the rebels. His natural leadership
        ability got him promoted to sergeant, with Zoë as his
        corporal. In 701TR, he helped plan and lead the liberation
        of Lorkin Castle. From 701-703TR, the `Independent Years,'
        he helped lead the fight against the hated Ivinians. In
        703TR, the Jarin leader, Gweffryn Seylnes, was mysteriously
        decapitated. Shâ held the men together for two more weeks,
        but the death of their leader demoralized the defenders and
        the castle fell to Clan Geldestaar. Shâ and Zoë just managed
        to slip over the wall and across the Anoth River ahead of
        the attackers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A witty, bitter and angry man, Shâ opposed the Ivinians to
        no avail. He lost more than the war; he lost his sense of
        compassion and forgiveness and all faith in the remaining
        Jarin lords and his god, Siem. There are now very few people
        he trusts. Shâ behaves as if he is intellectually and
        morally superior to the Ivinians, making his relationships
        with them hostile at best. Shâ bristles at the term Orbaal,
        referring to it as Occupied Jara and to its overlords as
        Ivinians, never Orbaalese.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the defeat at Lorkin, Shâ and Zoë crossed to Lythia
        and took up arms as mercenaries fighting for the Trierzi
        against the Shorkyni. In 713TR, on the Plains of Karetan,
        Shâ had the good fortune to capture the Baron of Suvas, Sir
        Dasen Queridona a wealthy (if unlucky) liegeman of Clan
        Pelanby. He ransomed him for a staggering £120. In an
        attempt to find the freedom he feels the world has denied
        him, Eshârel poured the ransom and the remains of his heart
        and soul into the purchase of a dilapidated dak, renaming
        her Lorkin. With the minimum repairs he set sail, free at
        last.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to legitimate transport runs, Shâ engages in
        what he likes to call &quot;perfectly legitimate
        entrepreneurial endeavors&quot;. No job is too big, too
        small, or too illegal, as long as it keeps his crew
        together and his ship sailing. Captain Ranals fancies
        himself a master planner, stealing from the rich and
        selling to the poor. He is very protective of his crew and
        lives by a very strong moral code centered on his word,
        his loyalty to his crew and an inconvenient sense of
        charity.

        Second in command of the `Lorkin,' Zoë is a loyal wartime
        friend of Captain Ranals. She was just fourteen when the
        Ivinians raided her village, searching for Jarin rebels. Shâ
        was hiding in her father's barn. When she went to warn him,
        a huscarl followed, intent on `interrogating' the shy,
        retiring milkmaid. Helpless against such a warrior, she
        froze in terror. Then, Shâ appeared like an avenging angel,
        saving Zoë from a vicious rape and almost certain
        death. Single-handedly, he killed the blond giant. Zoë fled
        with the rebels, but when the huscarl was discovered, the
        Ivinians torched the village; in their blood lust they
        killed everyone, including her entire family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first night, as she sat by the fire, homeless and alone,
        Zoë decided she would never be helpless again. Shâ took her
        under his wing, teaching her to fight. She became every bit
        the warrior as huscarls she hates. More than just an
        extraordinary warrior, she became the ultimate
        soldier. Always on hand when needed, always ready to give
        advice and input, and always prepared to follow orders even
        when those orders are contrary to her advice. She trusts Shâ
        implicitly and would never do anything to betray her loyalty
        to her Captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A green fifteen-year-old when she scaled the walls of Lorkin
        Castle, two years later, a hardened veteran, she slipped
        back over the wall. Using a hidden rowboat, Zoë and Shâ
        crossed the Anoth River and disappeared into the trackless
        delta. She lost a lot of good friends at Lorkin, but came
        out of it alive. After the war, Shâ led them east to
        Trierzon. For the next nine years they plied the only trade
        they knew, working as sell-swords in the constant
        skirmishing between the Trierzi and the Shorkyni.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool under fire, levelheaded, terse and with a dry wit, Zoë
        is completely at ease with herself. She has the strength,
        experience, initiative and self-confidence to take command
        when needed. Zoë is one of the few people Shâ trusts and she
        would follow him to hell and back without a second
        thought. The two have an instinctive shorthand born of a
        hundred shared battles and a lifetime friendship, allowing
        them to communicate an entire plan with a simple glance or
        raised eyebrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 715TR, Zoë married Hoban Fiôrfohd (Fiôr for short),
        Lorkin's pilot (against Shâ's advice). She wears a leather
        necklace as a symbol of her marriage bond. Fiôr is kind,
        gentle, romantic and has awoken something in Zoë she thought
        had disappeared long ago. However, the tight bond two
        decades of shared experiences has created between Zoë and
        Shâ occasional causes tension and jealousy between her
        husband and her Captain. Fiôr has accused Zoë of blindly
        following Shâ's orders and wonders if they have ever slept
        together (they haven't).

        The office of Royal Agent is a relatively recent one,
        having been created by the King only within the last two
        years. The intent was to have three noblemen (with an
        annual income of at least £20) per shire. Their task is to
        investigate and record all sudden deaths, treasure troves,
        shipwrecks and &quot;matters of interest to the
        crown,&quot; thus ensuring all fines and taxes due the
        King are collected. The Royal Agents report through the
        Inquisitor General to the Chancellor himself. They are a
        deliberate duplication and check on the powers of the
        nobility. There is much resentment of their position
        mainly by noblemen who see this position as an invasion of
        their absolute rights of justice on their manors. Few
        knights of sufficient wealth have been found to take up
        the positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Jorn Stury is one such knight. A veteran of the defense
        of Thay and the wars in Trierzon, he recently retired to the
        city. He has a comfortable townhouse and numerous shares in
        the wool business of Huge of Relaga, which keep him in
        adequate, if not lavish, comfort. At the insistence of his
        wife, in 718TR, Sir Jorn accepted the appointment as the
        King's Royal Agent for Lenedshire. Stubborn, strong-willed
        and a loyal King's man, he gets along well with Sheriff Sir
        Jenis Thabel, who lives in Cupeth, but has sometimes clashed
        with Lord Mayor and Clan Melesen who resent his interference
        in the administration of the city of Thay.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only Royal Agent for the massive Lenedshire, Sir Jorn is
        often on the road, traveling from village to keep to town
        investigating all manner of deaths and unusual
        occurrences. Scrupulously honest, he cannot be bribed and
        will arrest anyone who tries. Over the last two years, he
        has investigated numerous murders, suicides and two
        sturgeons washing up on the riverbanks. It is impossible for
        him to cover the entire shire, but as a loyal King's man, he
        does his best. He is aided by Gwyn, his common squire, body
        servant and officer of the court and Toris, his cleric cum
        scribe who records the findings of all his
        investigations.

        Warorel is the son of a sheepherder. Born a serf, he hated
        work and ducked out as often as possible. The second child,
        he was popular with the more gullible members of his clan,
        including his cousin who was Clanhead. He didn't fool his
        mother or his older sister though. They knew that he was
        constantly avoiding work, claiming to be practicing for the
        militia or rounding up stray animals when he was actually
        lying about sleeping in the woods. By the time he was
        fifteen, he began to reveal a serious vicious streak. At
        first, his father could keep him in line, but soon he grew
        too big and started hitting his father, then his mother and
        sister too. The Reeve, a large, tough ex-soldier had none of
        it and beat him severely several times when he caught him
        slacking. This only made Warorel more rebellious and
        mouthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the men of the village got together and gave him a
        severe beating for slapping his mother in the middle of the
        village, Warorel fled. He has reasonable skills from
        tracking lost sheep and finding places to hide and was able
        to avoid the hue and cry that was sent after him. He had
        learned a thing or two in the militia and took his bow and
        dagger with him. It was not long before he joined up with a
        gang of other runaway serfs who were brigands along the
        King's road. Immoral and absolutely ruthless, he killed off
        three of the strongest men by cutting their throats in their
        sleep and took control of the gang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warorel is five foot eight inches tall, 153 lbs. He has a
        medium complexion with startlingly blue eyes. He never combs
        or trims his long greasy brown hair and has poxmarks all
        over his face and body. He has a serious demeanour and
        dominates the gang through intimidation, skill with a dagger
        and his successful record of robberies. He suffers from a
        moderate case of cynophobia (fear of dogs), as a result of
        being attacked by the lord's hounds as a boy. He loves the
        power of having captives at his feet and often prolongs
        their agony before killing them to ensure there are no
        witnesses.

      <p>
        The youngest of four sons, there was no money to train
        Artanar for knighthood, nor sufficient land for an
        inheritance. Knowing he would have to fend for himself, he
        heeded well the lessons of his tutors and shadowed his
        father's bailiff, watching and learning. He soon developed
        into a good assistant. This brought him to the attention of
        a friend of his father s. When he was twenty-three, he left
        the family manor to join the household of his new
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Artanar has held many positions within his master's
        staff. He started out as an aide, personal servant and
        later, chamberlain. After many years of running his master's
        largest manor, he was promoted to assistant steward. When
        the steward died, he assumed full responsibility for
        overseeing his master's several manors. In 702TR, his
        beloved master died, leaving the estate in the hands of his
        twenty-year-old son. Overwhelmed by the responsibility, the
        young lordling turned to Artanar, his father's faithful
        servant, making him bailiff of the estate, a position he has
        now held for eighteen years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now 58 years old, Artanar's health is beginning to fail. He
        has a persistent hacking cough and becomes easily
        winded. His hands tremble and he is constantly cold. None of
        these physical frailties have affected his mind. He is sharp
        as a tack and knows everything about the operations of his
        master's lands. The servants treat him with a mixture of
        fear and reverence. He acts with the full confidence and
        backing of his master and they know it. Artanar always
        screens those who wish to see the lord. Of noble blood
        himself, other nobles do not intimidate him. His formidable

      The PCs need to meet with
      an important lord. Artanar, his bailiff, is standing in
      their way. He is suspicious of these adventurers and just as
      likely to throw them in the dungeon for a few days to cool
      their heels. The lord's men-at-arms obey Artanar without
      question. The PCs will find his questions probing and very
      insightful. He will catch them if they lie.

      His health worsening, Artanar wants to

      <p>
        Earny is a nasty piece of work. The bastard son of a
        washerwoman, he became a sailor at an early age. He rose to
        the rank of able-bodied seaman before a bad fall from a spar
        to the deck shattered his left knee. He spent months
        recovering and nearly starved. He now walks with a severe
        limp, aided by a walking stick.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his recovery, such as it was, he tried working as a
        longshoreman. However, his knee wasn't up to the strain and
        he had to quit. Fortunately, Earny was always good with his
        fists. He began working as a bouncer at one of the local
        sailors dives. Although not terribly smart, he noticed that
        the local whoremaster was making very good money. He soon
        weaselled his way into the prostitution business as an
        enforcer. Before long, he was running several of his own
        girls and paying a cut to the boss. One night, a quick and
        deadly blow from his walking stick resulted in a rapid
        promotion, making him the boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earny spent several years in Melderyn, before he bought a
        wagon and outfitted it as a mobile brothel. He follows the
        caravans, going wherever the money is. He currently has six
        prostitutes, five women (two in their 30s, two in their 20s
        and a 15 year old) and a thirteen-year-old boy. He treats
        them brutally. Raping them frequently to demonstrate his
        power over them. He dishes out cuffs and serious beatings
        almost on a whim. He considers them little more than
        cattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always on the lookout for new merchandise , Earny is not
        above kidnapping or buying a girl/boy from destitute
        parents. When the prostitutes get too old or poxed, he sells
        them off cheap. If they resist or he can't sell them, he
        will simply kill them and dump their bodies in the forest
        far from civilization. He does this in front of the other
        prostitutes to keep them in utter fear of him.
      </p>

      A very pretty young girl has gone missing

      they appeal to the PCs to help find her.

      A scantily clad boy slips into the

      intervene, he kills the boy in front them.

      <p>
        Fil was born a sheep farmer and will probably die a sheep
        farmer, however, he does have other skills. He discovered,
        quite by accident, as he grew out of puberty that his voice
        had matured into an amazing tenor, strong, powerful and
        clear, backed by tremendous stamina and lungpower. At first,
        he was embarrassed, but he couldn't help himself and would
        often sing while herding his father's sheep. Soon other
        members of the village heard about his skill and badgered
        him to perform at weddings, social and religious
        events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last two decades, Fil has become something a local
        celebrity in the Hundred. He is regularly called upon to
        sing. He has even come to the attention of several of the
        local manor lords. With his own lord's permission, he
        travels here and there singing. He has also mastered the
        simple shepherd's flute. He has a large repertoire of folk
        songs, dances and gigs popular with the rural folk. He is
        known to the Harper's Guild. They consider his folk music
        beneath their contempt, but this may not last, as several
        guilded harpers have been bumped from the program of
        important noble functions by this upstart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fil is happily married with three children, two daughters
        and a son. His unmarried brother lives with them. He prefers
        to tend to the crops and sheep and leave the celebrity to
        his elder brother. However, the income Fil receives in the
        form of gratuities is significant. It has allowed the two
        brothers to buy additional breeding stock and several more
        acres from the lord, making them quite comfortable for
        peasants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fil can be encountered at major gatherings anywhere within a
        day or two's walk from his home village. He often sings as
        he walks and it is not uncommon for him to have a gaggle of
        small children following him.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Local Entertainment.">
      While the PCs are staying in a
      local village they are invited to one of Fil's impromptu
      dances. He calls on them to dance with some of the local
      girls. The GM can use this as an opportunity for the PCs to
      break down the traditional suspicion of outsiders.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Militia Leader.">
      Fil's voice would put most Sergeants
      to shame. This has earned him the position of corporal in
      the local militia. When the PCs interact with the militia,
      Fil will be sent forward as a spokesman.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Talent Scouts.">
      The PCs are hired by the master of the
      local Harper's Guild to find this rural talent and convince
      him to formally join the guild. The PCs will have to track
      him down first. It will take a very good sales pitch even to
      get him to agree to meet the master.

        Originally from Orbaal, Hadyn has not lived there for twenty
        years. He left home at eighteen and since then, the sea has
        been his home. A skilled officer and pilot, he has found it
        easy to find work. He rarely stays with any one vessel for
        too long, because he hates the routine. Hadyn keeps a very
        detailed rudder (or record) of all his voyages, including
        accurate maps and meticulous notes. After twenty years, his
        rudder is up to eight thick, leatherbound, volumes. They are
        his most valuable possession. So valuable, that he made a
        complete copy, placed it in a waterproof chest and buried it
        on an island just a day's sail south of Cherafir. He updates
        both copies regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        An experienced pilot, Hadyn has visited every major port
        around Hârn, including Ulfshafen. He can pilot everything
        from an Orbaalese longship to a Trierzi karune. Until
        recently, he never was short of work. A pleasant, happy go
        lucky type, he was popular with crews and captains alike. He
        has never lost a ship to storm nor reef and his handling is
        always confident and precise. He frequently shaved as much
        as one day in twenty off a trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, several of Hadyn's former employers have been the
        victims of misfortune. In the last year, six vessels
        disappeared immediately after he left to seek new challenges
        . Rumours have begun to circulate that he is an agent for
        pirates. Although no one has openly accused him, the
        innuendo has been enough to blacklist him. He has now been
        out of work for eight weeks. He still has considerable
        savings, but has begun to worry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of his dark complexion, black hair and brown eyes,
        some people are surprised to discover he is actually
        Orbaalese, especially, because he speaks Hârnic without an
        accent. Other than a small scar on his right cheek, he has
        few remarkable features. He is allergic to milk and cheese
        and will break out in hives if he eats them. He prefers beer
        and sausages anyway.
      </p>

    <note type="hook" value="Have I got a pilot for you.">
      The pilot on the ship the
      PCs own (or are planning to sail on) suddenly takes
      ill. They are in desperate need of a replacement. Do they
      risk becoming pirate-bait by using Hadyn?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Bastards.">
      On a hunch, Hadyn checks his secret
      duplicate rudder. The lock shows signs it has been
      picked. Someone has been reading his rudder and used the
      information to pirate his previous ships. Using the rudder
      as bait, Hadyn hires the PCs to catch the thief.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Revenge.">
      Hadyn sold the pirates routes of captains
      who he feels cheated him. The pilot's guild suspects him,
      but they need proof. The PCs are hired to entrap
      him.

        Husraas is currently between positions. Born into a
        successful clan, he entered the family shipwright business
        at twelve. He showed tremendous natural talent and promise,
        developing swiftly over the next seven years. He had no
        problem graduating to journeyman. He travelled widely,
        collecting twelve recommendations in just two years, making
        him a master shipwright in his own right. Not wanting to
        return to Ivinia, he travelled to Orbaal where he accepted a
        position with Master Taareskeld in Geldeheim as a bonded
        master.
      </p>
      <p>
        A creative, inventive, innovative and artistic master,
        Husraas was soon at odds with his boss over the best way to
        complete several projects. Unfortunately, when Husraas gets
        excited or stressed, he has a very severe stutter. Master
        Taareskeld frequently used Husraas speech impediment to mock
        him, belittle his ideas and imply that he was stupid. A
        brilliant shipwright, this infuriated Husraas. Finally, the
        two came to blows and had to be physically separated by the
        journeymen. Husraas packed up his belongings and left the
        next morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Desperate to depart as quickly as possible, he refused to
        wait for the next ship and instead joined a merchant caravan
        heading south overland. Trained as a huscarl in his youth,
        Husraas signed on as a caravan guard in return for wages and
        free food. He has some vague ideas about perhaps heading
        south to Melderyn or east to Tharda, Kanday or Rethem. At
        this point he just wants to get as far away from Geldeheim
        as he can. No one in the caravan is aware he is actually a
        shipwright. He has two pack mules loaded with his personal
        belongings including letters of reference and his large
        collection of tools.

      The PCs patron is planning to send
      them on an expedition to Tuleme Falls to assess its
      suitability as a seaport. The only shipwright in Tashal
      wants nothing to do with the project. The PCs need an expert
      who can evaluate its suitability as a port and a
      shipyard. Rumour has it there is an Ivinian shipwright
      staying at the Temple of Sarajin.

      Husraas has accepted the lowly
      position of ships carpenter on the PCs ship or the one they
      are travelling on. They strike up a friendship. He is highly
      skilled and very unhappy. He is open to offers.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="What is he doing?">
      Over several months, the PCs
      encounter Husraas several times in different towns and
      cities. He has no visible means of support, but seems to
      have lots of money. He spends most of his time socializing
      with soldiers, drawing and making notes about castles,
      politics and conditions. He is very friendly, too
      friendly.

      <p>
        Failure has dogged Kalas every day of his life. The son of a
        Chandler, he followed his father into the trade, not because
        of any great desire to do it, just because he couldn't think
        of anything better to do. His father's friends took him as
        an apprentice and later a journeyman, eventually accepting
        him as a master, not because of his skill (which is minimal)
        but out of respect for his father. Eventually, Kalas
        inherited the business, which had been quite
        successful. Within six months he had run it into the
        ground. With creditors hounding him, he was forced to sell
        the franchise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never married, an only child and with both parents dead,
        there was nothing to keep him in Tharda. He took to the
        road, becoming little more than a peddler. Since his own
        wares were inferior, he took to reselling the goods of other
        guilds. A poor negotiator, he usually pays too much for
        wholesale and sells for too little at retail. He spends his
        days walking from village to village leading his stubborn
        old mule, Rodos. He barely makes enough to keep body and
        soul together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kalas can be most often encountered on the road as he
        travels the countryside. Widely travelled, he is a useful
        source of general knowledge of the local area where he is
        encountered.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Peddler.">
      The PCs have need of an item not commonly
      available in the countryside. Kalas happens to be visiting
      the village they are in and has the item among his
      goods. Unfortunately for the PCs, although it looks fine, he
      is selling shoddy goods and the item fails at a critical
      moment. Buyers beware!
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Travelling Companion.">
      The PCs need to go from one
      location to another, but they don't have a map or
      directions. Kalas strikes up a conversation with one of the
      PCs. For a very reasonable fee, he will make a detour and
      guide them there. The problem is, he ends up getting them
      lost anyway.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Collection Agents.">
      The chandler has slipped out of
      town in the middle of the night to avoid paying his
      creditors. They are suitably annoyed and hire the PCs to
      find the little bugger and bring him back to face the
      law.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="It wasn't me.">
      The PCs come across the remains of a
      caravan, which had been attacked by brigands. They surprise
      Kalas who is looting the remains. He is stealing the clothes
      from the dead and taking everything he can. Do the PCs join
      him or arrest him? It is time for a morality check. If they
      join him, moments later the Sheriff and his men arrive and
      arrest them for murder and robbery.

        In her youth, Kora was an attractive woman, but age and a
        life spent mostly outdoors have taken their toll. Her hair
        is steel grey, her skin tanned and wrinkled, and her attire
        seems to be little more than rags layered upon rags. She is
        accompanied by a grey and white, wiry hair terrier named
        Hus, that never leaves her side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Peoni's missionaries were largely successful in
        converting the peoples of Hârn, there are still places where
        the old ways are followed and where the old beliefs are part
        of the folklore of even the most devout Peonians. In these
        places, the self-styled keepers of the ancient lore are as
        welcome as any mendicant priest of Peoni. Kora of Serdica is
        one such mystic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some call her a midwife, others call her a wise woman, but
        every village between Harden and Kobing knows Kora. Born to
        a widow of the Treasure War, Kora followed in her mother's
        footsteps as she travelled from village to village along
        Genin's Trail, repeating the oral histories of the peoples
        of the Horka, Ulmerien and Osel valleys and, at the right
        times and places, leading the ancient rites. Now the last of
        her line, Kora continues the tradition as she travels
        Genin's Trail on her own. She never takes payment for her
        religious services, but earns what coin she can, aiding
        births, tending the sick and telling fortunes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kora knows the ways and languages of the barbarians, and
        knows more of the region's ancient lore than any civilised
        scholar. Her forays into the forest in search of herbs for
        her potions have led her to discover places and things lost
        to common knowledge centuries ago.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Trail Guide and Interpreter.">
      Kora is as familiar
      with Genin's Trail and its hazards as any mercenary guard or
      caravan master. She might seek to join PCs travelling with
      the caravan or, for a fee, be persuaded to guide PCs
      travelling the trail between caravans.

      The PCs are in search of
      an ancient site in eastern Hârn. Surprisingly, their
      inquiries take them to Kora as the best source of
      information on pre-Migration War cultures and
      civilisation. She insists on accompanying the PCs.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Access.">
      Kora is well known in the settlements along
      Genin's Trail as both a healer and one wise in the old ways.
      Most of her clients are peasants the descendants of the
      region's early settlers but even the nobility sometimes call
      on her for aid in time of need. In some noble houses, Kora
      can sometimes gain an audience denied to others.

        Koril is a young thirty-year-old mercantyler from Chelemby,
        the greatest trading state of the northwest of Lythia. He
        sports flowing tawny hair, bright blue eyes, a neat beard,
        and an easy smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is the Factor of the Cherafir Kántehus (or
        &quot;trading house&quot;) of Clan Aemon of
        Chelemby. Aemon are the ruling clan of Chelemby, but hail
        originally from Melderyn, so the Cherafir Kántehus is of
        particular significance. Koril leads a group of Chelembian
        traders based in the Alienage of Cherafir, who deal with
        goods from all over Hârn, and export them to Chelemby and
        other points around the northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is the grandson of Aestrid Aemon (a daughter of the first
        King of Chelemby) and Jamys Hulgath, a Melderyni
        noble. Aestrid was also Aemon's Factor at Cherafir, and died
        in mysterious circumstances just two years after Koril's
        father's birth. As a result, Koril was born in Chelemby
        city, but returned to take up his grandmother's post in
        TR716. He has prospered under the guidance of his
        grandfather, Jamys, who at 79 is a frail but sharp
        trader. Koril is extremely interested in uncovering the
        truth about his grandmother's fate.

    <note type="hook" value="Fetch and Carry.">
      Koril has purchased a large shipment
      of goods. Unfortunately, they must be picked up at the
      source. On a trusted friend's recommendation, he hires the
      PCs to retrieve the items on his behalf. When they arrive,
      the shipment has already been picked up by another group
      claiming to be in Koril's employ.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Bloody Foreigner.">
      The success of Chelembian traders
      has nearly bankrupted several Melderyni mercantylers. In
      desperation, they have decided to kidnap Koril's grandfather
      and then use the ransom money to pay off their debts. The
      PCs are either hired by the mercantylers to kidnap the old
      man or by Koril to rescue him.

    <note type="hook" value="Silent Partners.">
      Through his agents, Koril discovers
      that the PCs have some extra cash they are looking to
      invest. He approaches them with a plan to purchase Khuzdul
      locks in Azadmere, trade them for wine in Shorkyne, trade
      that for amber in Chelemby and then use the profits to buy
      whale oil in Orbaal. He promises them a large return on
      their investment. They are welcome to join him, but only as
      silent partners.

      Koril has been poking into the
      circumstances surrounding the death of his grandmother,
      however, his alien-status has hindered the investigation. He

      group to follow them up for him.

      <p>
        The oldest child, Lady Elena was sixteen when her mother
        died. Her father appointed her chatelaine (lady of the
        house). She ran the household, supervised the servants,
        played hostess to their many important visitors, acted as
        advisor and confidant and mothered her two younger brothers
        (then 12 and 9). As the years passed and her father drifted
        into senility, she became de facto bailiff of the family's
        six manors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never married, Elena devoted herself to caring for her
        family. She found suitable brides for her brothers and
        tended their ailing father. When he died in 716TR, the
        estate passed to the eldest son. A loyal brother, it soon
        became clear that there was no room for two ladies of the
        house. Lady Elena did the noble thing and stepped aside to
        allow her brother's wife to assume the role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spared a battle-royale, her brother gave her their large
        townhouse in Tashal and a generous monthly stipend in
        compensation. Elena took a dozen servants, including her two
        ladies-in-waiting and two faithful men-at-arms, and moved to
        the city. A beautiful and skilled manipulator, she soon
        became a regular at the royal court. Lady Elena navigates
        the swirling intrigue and gossip of the royal court with
        grace and aplomb; representing her clan well. She keeps her
        brother abreast of political developments.
      </p>
      <p>
        An attractive and wealthy woman, Lady Elena has yet to find
        a man that meets her high standards, though she does have a
        weakness for romantic poets. A strong, selfconfident person,
        she is looking for an intellectual equal who respects her
        skills and abilities. Elena would like to have children of
        her own, but at her age (given the health risks) she doubts
        she ever will and this saddens her.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Spymaster.">
      There is more to Lady Elena than meets the
      eye. Intensely faithful and loyal to her family's liege
      lord, the Earl of Vemion, she is secretly his chief agent in
      the Royal Court and Tashal, responsible for a limited but
      diligent network of spies. The PCs have come to the lady's
      attention and are summoned to meet her. She offers them a
      small, but challenging, task. If they are successful and
      discrete, more important jobs will follow.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Your Basic Escort Job.">
      Lady Elena wants to go on a
      trip. Publicly, she wants to see the fabled Wizard's Isle
      and the Palace of Masks in Aleath. Privately, she wants to
      gauge Melderyni and Kandian support for the various factions
      in the upcoming Succession Crisis. The PCs are hired to
      provide additional protection for her small caravan. The pay
      is good and the job seems simple enough. The PCs are unaware
      that there are those that would like to make the lady (and
      her servants) disappear for good.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The son of middling nobility, it was a forgone conclusion
        that Taran would be sent to be a page and then squire. He
        was not consulted. His father contacted a friend and in his
        eighth summer took him by horse the long ride to his new
        master's estate. His new master is not a cruel or evil man,
        just indifferent. Taran is just another squire. The sergeant
        at arms ensures he trains several hours a day with
        weapons. The lady of the house tutors him in dancing,
        heraldry and courtly manners and the senior squire ensures
        he gets his share of crappy little jobs like polishing his
        lord's armor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taran finds the whole process of being a squire tedious and
        uninteresting.  What excites him is the teeming life of the
        town. He frequently slips away from his tasks and lessons to
        visit the market. He usually has a handful of farthings for
        a meat pie or small ale. Proudly sporting his short sword,
        he goes from market to tavern, looking for new and
        interesting people and stories of far away lands. Over the
        last few years, he has heard quite a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he wants to be a knight, the young squire dreams of
        an easier, faster route, lined with glory and tales of great
        deeds, not polishing helms and hacking at wooden posts into
        kindling. Because of this thirst for adventure, he has
        already tried to hook up with a few groups of hardy
        adventurers, only to have the sergeant at arms catch up with
        the party a few days later and drag him back, much to his
        embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taran can be a real pain to serious adventuring parties. He
        sees himself as a rugged adventurer; he is more like comic
        relief. He will try and join a party, but if denied will
        trail along behind making a nuisance of himself.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Experienced Guide.">
      Taran overhears that the PCs need
      a guide to their next destination. He claims to have first
      hand knowledge of how to get there. In fact, he only past
      through the place once eight years ago with his father and
      ends up getting the PCs completely lost.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Fetch Him Back.">
      Taran is in the service of the same
      lord as the PCs. He has run off with a group of disreputable
      adventurers. The PCs are dispatched to find him and bring
      him back. His new friends have taken a shine to the boy and
      don't want to let him go. He doesn't want to leave, claiming
      the PCs plan to kill him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Running For His Life.">
      Taran's snooping has gone too
      far. He overheard his lord plotting treason and was
      spotted. Now he is running for his very life. He convinces
      the PCs to let him join them for free. Then another group,
      send by his lord, arrive to take him back for
      execution.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Born on a small Chybisan manor, Tharo is the only child of
        half-villein parents. They died when he was twenty-two and
        he inherited his father's acres. He is an uninspired farmer,
        but gets by. His twelve acres easily support him in
        comfort. He is unmarried.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three years ago, word reached the manor lord that there was
        a group of hostile Pagaelin threatening the village. The
        knight summoned two yeomen and six militia, including Tharo,
        and rode out to track them down. Unfortunately, they were
        ambushed and all but Tharo and the knight were killed. Tharo
        survived because he turned coward and fled, though in the
        chaos no one noticed. Eventually, he returned to find the
        men slaughtered and the knight badly injured and left for
        dead. He managed to carry his lord home, where with luck and
        a good Peonian physician he survived. Unaware of Tharo's
        cowardice, the knight hailed him a great hero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, Tharo has been relieved of all work obligations
        on his lord's land. He has become the lord's favourite,
        often being chosen as a messenger. While Tharo is away, the
        Reeve must find other people to work his land. This has made
        him unpopular with the other villagers, already struggling
        after the loss of so many of the best and strongest
        men. Tharo worries constantly that someone will discover his
        secret and so has developed severe stomach ulcers, which
        cause recurrent nausea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his failings, Tharo is a very imaginative, clever
        and resourceful person. A barracks room lawyer, he has
        developed a very arrogant front when dealing with the other
        villagers (especially the Reeve). This hides grave
        insecurities.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Personal Messenger.">
      Tharo's lord has heard of the
      PC's reputation, is a distant relation or shares past
      history with them. He dispatches Tharo to find the PCs to
      ask them to come help him hunt down the Pagaelin that
      slaughtered the militia. Tharo has spent weeks trying to
      catch up with them and is anxious to return to the
      village.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Village Hero.">
      The PCs are passing through the village
      and are invited to dine with the lord. If one of the PCs has
      a bow, he suggests a friendly wager against the local hero.
      Tharo is not much of a challenge and looses. The lord
      becomes upset, refusing to make good his wager.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Reinforcements.">
      The PCs need help. They ask the local
      lord and he volunteers Tharo. He tells them he is an
      outstanding longbowman and solid soldier. If the PCs are
      foolish enough to trust him, he turns coward and flees at a
      critical moment.

      <p>
        Eryla is a farm boy from Golotha. He worked as a mercenary
        and sometimes a brigand. While robbing the Baron of Quste's
        tax collector, his partner's horse was shot, forcing them to
        double up. As they galloped through the town, soldiers
        started to catch them. In desperation, Eryla dumped first
        his partner and then the bags of silver, scattering them and
        causing the serfs to swarm into the street, cutting off
        pursuit. The serfs worship his memory as a hero who steals
        from the rich and gives to the poor. They even built a
        statue to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after the fiasco in Quste, Eryla fell in with a gang
        of petty thieves led by a lowlife named Marco. They got wind
        that a ship named Lorkin was delivering a shipment of
        crossbows to a rival gang. Eryla tracked the ship down and
        they ambushed Zoë and Shâ. During the standoff, while being
        robbed by Marco's gang, Shâ sweettalked Eryla; Shâ offered
        him a 10% share and his own private bunk. Eryla stabbed
        Marco in the leg and joined up with Shâ instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his personality problems and propensity for
        disloyalty, he's a mercenary worth having, fearless and
        skilled. Big, tough, dull-witted, violent, often unpleasant,
        and a self-serving bandit, he is a good sailor and fighter
        with many years experience. Unfortunately, his skill with
        weapons doesn't translate well to situations not involving
        money or violence; Eryla's brawn-not-brain approach usually
        causes more problems than it solves. An utter mercenary, he
        works for whoever pays him the best, at the moment, that's
        Shâ, so that's where Eryla's loyalty lies ­ until something
        better comes along. He loves his mom as much as a good fight
        and sends money home to her instead of spending it all on

      <p>
        There are many clerics of Ilvir wandering throughout
        Hârn. Mansu Quig appears to be a typical member of the lot,
        poor, slightly crazy and prone to ranting. In his more lucid
        moments he claims to be a member of the Order of the Yellow
        Hand and searches through the records of other temples for
        obscure references. Few pay any attention to him. The truth
        is more sinister indeed. Mansu Quig did start as a member of
        the Order of the Yellow Hand, but has not been in Tashal for
        over 20 years. In 699, he left on a pilgrimage to
        Araka-Kalai and never returned. During his time at
        Araka-Kalai, Mansu became a disciple of Tave and joined the
        Dark Order [see ArakaKalai page 26]. He descended into the
        Pit of Ilvir in 703.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 715, Mansu secretly emerged from the pit and travelled
        to western Hârn. He is a &quot;missionary&quot;, the Dark
        Order's main agent in the area. He is directly responsible
        for the various attacks on the &quot;slavers&quot; who
        capture Ivashu for the Pamesani games. Skilled at making a
        number of herbal poisons, Mansu favours the use of such on
        his blowgun darts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mansu uses his cover to visit the Ilviran temples in
        Shiran, Coranan, and Golotha to gather information
        regarding expeditions to capture Ivashu. He also receives
        information from other members of the Dark Order still
        working near Araka-Kalai. Mansu uses this information to
        arrange ambushes, &quot;accidents&quot; and liberate
        captured ivashu. Sometimes he participates directly, but
        his usual method is to act through intermediaries such as
        the Polan-Tekek, whom he rescued in 716. Currently, Mansu
        is coordinating a large operation designed to cause a
        major disruption to the Pamesani games in all three of its
        main venues (Golotha, Coranan and Shiran).

      <p>
        Clan Erons is well respect by their liege lord. Royal
        Foresters for generations, their duties include: patrolling
        the forest, guarding against poachers, tracking bandits, and
        serving as guides for hunting nobles. The clan patrols both
        as small groups and individuals. Finbar prefers to patrol on
        his own. Though he has discovered and reported evidence of
        poachers and brigands before, he has never captured any of
        them on his own. Finbar has become a popular huntsman with
        the nobility. His forester duties have allowed him to see
        more of the country, villages, and manors than most men his
        age. While Finbar would not have chosen this vocation, he
        does enjoy the attention he receives as a bearer of news and
        messages from village to village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finbar is a good-looking man with a charming personality and
        so has no shortage of female companionship. Ladies young and
        old, wives and widows, have all shared his bed. Some are
        wise enough to know that they are not his only companion;
        others are foolish enough to believe they are his one and
        only love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clan Erons has always belonged to the Laranian
        laity. However, after only one visit to a Halean temple,
        Finbar quickly converted. Since then, he has devoted himself
        to worshipping Halea, in secret. Should this fact be brought
        to the attention of the clan elders, Finbar would be
        expelled from his clan. Far from being deterred by the
        danger it actually excites him. Finbar is actively seeking
        an opportunity to make another temple visit.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Evidence of Indiscretion.">
      Finbar has impregnated a young noblewoman. When her
      condition was discovered, she concocted a story about being
      raped in the woods by a masked bandit. She didn't say
      anything because she was not supposed to be in the woods to
      begin with. Her father starts an extensive search for this
      &quot;bandit&quot;. The PCs are hired to assist with the
      capture.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Guide.">
      The PCs need a guide. The local lord
      volunteers Finbar. For reasons of his own, Finbar does not
      want the PCs to achieve their objective and sets out to
      mislead them.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Market Day.">
      People come from far and wide to shop and
      enjoy market day. Unfortunately for Finbar, this puts a
      number of his girlfriends in the same place at the same
      time. The PCs witness Finbar running from a gang of angry
      women.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Payoff.">
      The PCs spot Finbar with a group of
      brigands. He immediately enlists the PCs aid in capturing
      them. He has a suspiciously fat purse for a
      forester.

        It would break his mother's heart to see how her eldest (and
        favourite) child, Kres, has turned out. Born into serfdom on
        a manor farm, Kres was raised in a family of devout
        Peonians. He was only twelve when his father died, leaving
        his mother and five younger siblings with nothing but their
        obligations to the manor lord. He and his mother struggled
        to keep their acres farmed and fulfil their feudal
        obligations, but the lord was unsympathetic to their
        plight. Before long, the family was near starvation. That is
        when Kres started poaching rabbits and other small
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next five years were hard for the family. Kres and his
        siblings grew older and were able to provide more
        labour. Kres' mother never asked him how or where he got the
        extra meat he brought to the table. On one hunting trip,
        Kres discovered a group of bandits sleeping in the forest,
        seizing the opportunity; he snuck into the camp and made off
        with a crossbow and a large hunting knife. He hid them in
        the woods not far from the manor and started hunting larger
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was seventeen, things went from bad to worse; he was
        caught in the act of poaching a small deer, and recognized
        by the foresters. Fleeing the manor, Kres narrowly escaped
        with his life, but the lord had his family punished for his
        crimes. His mother died in the lord's dungeon. Kres never
        learned what happened to the rest of his family. He has
        spent the past thirteen years living off the land, working
        as a mercenary, or mostly resorting to brigandry to make a
        living.
      </p>
      <p>
        The life of a Brigand is a hard one. The once devout Peonian
        has turned to Agrik for his spiritual strength. Among bandit
        groups, he has a reputation as a ruthless cold-hearted
        killer that will go out of his way to kill nobles,
        especially manor lords. Kres sometimes works entirely alone,
        and rarely stays with any one group for very long,
        preferring to work just a few jobs before moving on. He is
        well known among the permanent and semi-permanent bandit
        groups.

      <p>
        It has been over two years since Digger (as he is now known)
        was found in a ditch, naked and beaten to within an inch of
        his life. The Peonian cleric who found him took him in and
        worked desperately for days just to keep him alive. When he
        finally awoke, Digger could not remember his name or
        anything about his past.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beating has left him with a bad limp from a partially
        crushed left hip. His unkempt hair hides the fact that most
        of his right ear is missing. He is also deaf in that
        ear. The vision in his right eye is dim and spotty. Though
        he retains his intelligence, Digger has problems expressing
        himself and speaks very slowly. He is not as dim-witted as
        most would believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his recovery, Digger lived off the charity of
        others. Although he does not have recollections of his past,
        he is a proud man. As soon as he could, he began to work to
        support himself. This has predominantly entailed taking day
        labour jobs such as digging ditches, removing rocks and
        other basic tasks. In return for a place to sleep, the
        Peonians give him chores to do around the temple. Digger
        donates his meagre earnings (a few farthings) for the meals
        the temple provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each night, the nightmares come. He relives the attack, but
        can never see the faces of his tormentors. Sometimes, he
        sees the face of a woman. He knows she is speaking his name,
        but can never quite hear what she is saying. Only by working
        to the brink of exhaustion can he avoid the
        nightmares.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Peonians pity and fear for him. He is a man haunted by
        an unknown past and an uncertain future. Digger needs to
        know what happened to him, who he really is and why he was
        beaten and left for dead. But, he fears where the answers
        might lead and sometimes wonders if it is better for the
        people who knew him to believe that he really is
        dead.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Heraldry of Torment.">
      A group of nobles pass by
      Digger as he is clearing rocks from a field. As he looks at
      them, he falls to the ground and cowers, holding his
      head. One of them wears a badge of heraldry that he
      recognizes from his nightmares.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Is that who I think it is?">
      Someone believes that they
      recognize Digger, but is unsure. They hire the PCs to
      investigate the man. Is this Earl Meleken?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Finishing the Job.">
      The PCs witness a cloaked man
      attacking Digger. It is obvious the attacker has the
      advantage and will finish him soon. If they intervene, the
      attacker will flee. Why was he attacking this poor soul?. GM

      <p>
        Geitir was a sickly child; his family marvels that he
        survived to reach adulthood. Although he grew to be tall, he
        is thinner and weaker than his siblings. During his
        illnesses, his grandfather entertained him with many lively
        and exciting tales, including Sarajin and his battles
        against the Pradeyalkri, dwarves and dragons, the heroes of
        Ivinia and fierce shieldmaidens. He also taught him about
        the Ljarl, Sarajin's code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was twelve, Geitir impressed a travelling skald with
        his knowledge of the Eddas (narrated folktales). After
        staying at the thran for a few months, the skald took him as
        his apprentice. Geitir spent the next six years travelling
        with his master, learning music, expanding his knowledge of
        the Eddas, and developing a deep respect for the culture and
        traditions of his people. Remembering the Eddas told to him
        by his grandfather, Geitir started writing the stories down
        in a journal. By comparing different versions, and sharing
        with other skalds, he hopes piece together a more
        comprehensive early history of the Ivinian
        peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        After his years of training, Geitir's master told him that
        it was time for him to travel on his own, to find his own
        way in the world. Geitir's first stop was at his home
        thran, to see his family, and show them that he had made
        something of himself in the world. Within a few weeks he
        began to understand something else his mentor had told
        him. &quot;Once you take on the mantel of a skald, your
        heart will know no other home.&quot; When spring came to
        his thran, Geitir bid his family farewell and set out with
        the first ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        His health has improved greatly since his childhood; he is
        still susceptible to respiratory illnesses and carries a
        number of medicinal herbs with him wherever he
        goes.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Rune Stone.">
      Geitir has been told that there is an
      old rune stone high up on the slopes of a nearby
      mountain. He wishes to see it, but needs companions to help
      him with the journey. He can offer little in payment other
      than immortalizing their journey in song.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Translator.">
      Geitir translates a runic document
      for the PCs. Only later do the PCs discover that his
      translation was flawed. Were the mistakes on purpose or
      not?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Judge.">
      Geitir is playing at a thran where the PCs
      are also staying. A dispute occurs between one of the PCs
      and a local man. The two are brought before the thran
      valhakar. He asks Geitir to advise him of a solution in
      accordance with the Ljarl.

      <p>
        Barris of Gorn is a journeyman hideworker. His master owns
        one of the local franchises and considers the young man
        quite skilled for one so early in his career. The journeyman
        is especially noted for his high quality leather boots. He
        works hard, spending his days preparing hides, mixing
        chemical concoctions to treat the leather and complete all
        manner of fetid tasks. The son of an ostler, Barris has a
        good sense of which hides will make the best saddles or tack
        and is usually able to sell these to his father at a slight
        premium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of saving his hard earned coin, Barris enjoys
        spending his money on drinking and wenching. When the
        day's duties are complete, he can be found drinking and
        carousing with his friends. At the close of the evening,
        Barris likes to engage in a &quot;good ruckus&quot;, as he
        is fond of calling it. These brawls have lead to several
        missing teeth, a broken nose, scarred ears and a few
        cracked ribs. The damage he has meted out is far
        worse. With his size, skill and stamina, few of the locals
        are willing to trade blows with him anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of local opponents has led to a new spectator
        sport, loosely called &quot;Traveller
        Baiting&quot;. Whenever there are strangers in town, the
        locals try to manoeuvre them into a confrontation with
        Barris. Bets are quietly laid on the outcome. The local
        constabulary is unofficially involved to ensure things
        don't get too far out of hand. They will intervene if
        weapons are drawn. They profit by occasionally
        &quot;fining&quot; Barris and his opponents in return for
        keeping them out of the Lord's dungeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Barris' master has implored him to stop his brawling many
        times, but he continues to fight. The head hideworker
        tolerates this behaviour only so long as Barris continues to
        show up for work every morning, put in a good days' work and
        produce high quality goods.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Strangers in Town.">
      The PCs experience &quot;Traveller Baiting&quot; first
      hand. If the PCs seriously injure Barris, the local
      officials will not be lenient.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="A Lesson in Manners.">
      Not everyone is as amused as the
      locals by Barris' behaviour. A former victim hires the PCs
      to teach him a lesson he won't soon forget.

    <note type="hook" value="An Accidental Death.">
      One of Barris' opponents has
      died from his injuries. Knowing his likely fate, he has

      The love of a good woman has mellowed
      Barris. He now lives peacefully, raising his family. This
      changes when he believes, rightly or wrongly, that one of
      the PCs has wronged his beloved wife. He wraps his knuckles
      with leather strips.

      <p>
        The Beitis Clan has been making weapons for generations and
        are considered to be among the finest weaponcrafter clans in
        all of Ivinia. The wealthiest members of Ivinian society
        seek to buy their weapons and armor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jorg Beitis, like most young Ivinian men, spent a few years
        of his youth travelling for both trade and Viking. A spear
        wound to his left leg convinced him to return to his thran
        and settle down. Since then he has become one of the best
        weaponcrafters of his generation and possibly the best the
        clan has ever produced. He specializes in swords and
        daggers, making weapons that are strong, light and very well
        balanced. His swords are especially favoured by
        Shieldmaidens because of how easy they are to
        handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few weeks ago, Jorg started having a strange recurring
        dream. In the dream, he used a strange misshapen piece of
        iron to forge a sword. He tried to put the dream out of his
        head, until a man showed up at his forge wanting to sell a
        piece of iron he had found on a glacier field. It was the
        metal from his dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jorg purchased the metal and that night, under the light of
        a full moon, started forging a sword. He laboured for three
        days and nights, non-stop. His clan thought that he was
        possessed, but seeing what was taking shape in the forge,
        they left him alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was done, Jorg had produced the finest sword anyone
        in his clan had ever seen, a blade of both beauty and deadly
        functionality. Once he had recovered from his ordeal, Jorg
        knew that there was one more thing to be done. He needed to
        take the sword to Mount Ilbengaad to seek Sarajin's blessing
        of the weapon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tokis was raised by his mother after his father and two
        older brothers were lost at sea. She eked out a living for
        her son and herself raising vegetables and acting as a
        midwife and physician to the poorer members of the
        thran. When Tokis was old enough, he provided for the two of
        them by working on the fishing boats of other clan
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most members of the clan, Tokis learned to use a spear
        and round shield at an early age. It was not until he was in
        his late teens that he had the chance to learn the short
        bow. The huscarl instructing him was so impressed with his
        ability he gave him a bow and quiver of arrows to practice
        with. Since then, Tokis has become the best archer in the
        clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blessed with good looks, Tokis has been the object of
        affection for many young girls, but there is only one woman
        that has captured his heart. Tokis has pledged his love to
        Erska Stutgar, but did not have nearly enough to meet her
        family's bride price. In hopes of earning her bride price,
        Tokis signed on as a sailor on a trading ship bound for
        Chelemby. He asked Erska to wait for him. If he did not have
        enough for the bride price when he returned, he would
        release her from her pledge. It took him three years and a
        lot of hard work to earn her bride price.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he returned, he discovered that Erska had married the
        year before. His own mother acted as midwife to Erska's
        first child just weeks before his return. Heartbroken, Tokis
        gave his hard earned coin to his mother and returned to the
        sea. Since then he has drifted, never staying with one ship
        or crew for long.

      <p>
        No one took Falkis seriously for the first fifteen years of
        his life. Cruel jokes and taunts about his height
        abounded. Falkis heeded his father's advice and never showed
        how deeply these jokes affected him. Instead, a reservoir of
        tightly controlled anger grew within his heart. His prayers
        to Sarajin always ended with a request to give him an
        opportunity to prove his worth to the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rogna pirates attacked the coastal thran where he lived on
        his fifteenth birthday. During the fighting, all the years
        of rage coiled up inside him boiled over. Falkis took an axe
        and attacked the invaders without concern for his own
        safety. The other warriors from his thran watched in awe as
        Falkis, in a berserker rage, cut down seven men in as many
        heartbeats and forced the remaining raiders to retreat to
        their ship. His clansmen had to restrain him when he started
        to chase the ship into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three full days passed before Falkis opened his eyes
        again. It was several weeks before he fully recovered from
        the injuries he had unknowingly received during the
        battle. When his recovery was complete, the Valhakar
        elevated him from clansman to huscarl and gifted him with
        the armor and weapons appropriate to his new station. Since
        that day, no one has dared utter jokes about his
        stature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Falkis has become even more devoted to the worship of
        Sarajin since his elevation to huscarl. He has never made
        another request, realizing that the icy lord's boons come
        with a price. He has learned how to work himself into a
        berserker rage at will, though he uses this gift
        sparingly. So far, he has never injured a friend while the
        blood lust was upon him, but he fears that one day his
        violent rage will claim the life of a fellow clansman by
        mistake.

      <p>
        At 90 years of age, Zirshath is still fairly young and
        adventurous - for a Khuzdul. Born and raised in mason clan,
        Zirshath is well schooled in engineering and
        architecture. However, his passion is not for building
        things, but destroying them. The Khuzdul have not laid siege
        to any fortification for thousands of years, but maintain
        good records. Zirshath has studied them all. He has examined
        and sketched every piece of siege equipment within Azadmere,
        from catapults to trebuchet, ballistae to rams. He has
        studied every manner of breaching castle walls; including
        some texts older and wiser Khuzdul would have preferred he
        never found. Now, he is seeking an opportunity to put his
        theoretical knowledge to the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no opportunities in Azadmere, Zirshath has quietly used
        human intermediaries to find a client willing to pay for his
        skills. His clan elders do not approve of his intentions,
        but neither have they actively prevented him from seeking a

        Zirshath has collected his notes and theories into a
        book. Because of its value, Zirshath guards the book closely
        and keeps it with him at all times. The knowledge contained
        within would be of immense value to any human nation, both
        for its utility in warfare and for the engineering and
        technological advances that could be derived from it
        contents. The book is written in the Khuzan runic and
        encoded with a cipher of Zirshath's own invention. Without
        deciphering and translation, only a small number of
        illustrations might be of use to an expert engineer. He has
        not considered the potential positive or negative impact to
        human society should it fall into their hands.

        At twenty-three, Dafyd is already an experienced mercenary
        and horseman. He rarely talks about his past. If anyone
        cares to ask, he simply tells them that his father was
        killed during Ezar's War, his mother died bearing him and he
        was raised in a church orphanage. All of which is
        true. However, he omits two important details. His father
        was a Rethemi knight and it was the Agrikan church that
        raised him when his mother died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dafyd survived, even thrived, in the harsh environment of
        his childhood. At fourteen, he joined a mercenary company as
        a squire. Dafyd tended to the captain's horses and learned
        the trade. He was a talented and quick study. Since then, he
        has worked with a number of different companies, taking him
        all over Hârn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dafyd supplements his mercenary salary by providing
        information to his friends in the Agrikan church. He prefers
        to simply report his observations and let them decide which
        information is of value. For obvious reasons, he keeps his
        relationship with the church quiet. He is quite willing to
        kill to protect this secret, but usually just moves on to a
        different mercenary company when people start asking too
        many questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, Dafyd has shown no interest in leading his own
        company or even serving as an officer. Despite this, his
        officers respect his experience, and he is quite capable of
        swaying their decisions if he feels strongly about an
        issue. Dafyd's preference seems to be to influence things
        from behind the scenes rather then dealing with the
        day-to-day responsibilities of leadership.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Hit.">
      Dafyd's mercenary company is providing
      additional escorts for a Laranian official. The Agrikan
      church has paid him to make sure the official does not reach
      his destination. The PCs get caught in the middle.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Converts.">
      The PCs are serving in the same company
      as Dafyd. He has had enough of the poor leadership and
      decides to seize control of the company. He will try to
      recruit the PCs to his side. If they seem open to it, he
      will try to convert them to Agrikanism as well. On the
      Run. While serving somewhere in eastern Hârn, Dafyd's
      religious affiliation is revealed. Now, he is on the run,
      trying to reach Tharda or Rethem. The PCs are tasked with
      capturing him. His mercenary friends may aid his
      escape.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Rescue.">
      The PCs are in need of aid when Dafyd
      comes along. He agrees to help them, but expects to get
      paid. If the PCs do not have enough cash, he may become a
      greater threat than the original problem.

      <p>
        Brynn's father, Aud, is the chief of the Temhui or
        &quot;Iron Folk&quot; Hodiri. Since Kjal Forsetha claimed
        the Barony of Geda, the two of them have grown to be
        friends. Aud has traded many horses directly to the Baron
        rather than taking them to the Lerenil or Burzyn horse
        fairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 716, Brynn's father arranged for him to stay with Baron
        Forsetha at Caer Geda. He told Brynn to learn the ways of
        the Chybisan people and the other &quot;Shiny
        Hats&quot;. His father believes that the future of the
        Hodiri lies with trade and alliance with the civilized
        peoples, not the conquest proposed by Jherdela.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brynn has lived at Geda as part of the Baron's entourage,
        raising and caring for horses, arranging horse trades,
        training for war with the huscarls, guiding hunting
        parties, and learning to appreciate Ivinian ale. He began
        his stay at Geda with the intent to learn everything he
        could and then share that information with Jherdela. It
        did not take long for his opinions to change. He is
        beginning to see his father's wisdom and agrees that
        Jherdela may be following the wrong path. While the Hodiri
        outnumber the Chybisans, they serve as a useful buffer
        between the Hodiri and the rest of the
        &quot;civilized&quot; nations. Brynn believes that
        attacking Chybisa would only open the door for the Hodiri
        to be attacked the way the Solori have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until the arrival of Ygwelve, Brynn had been considering
        returning to his tribe. Since her arrival, he has been
        acting strangely. Smitten, he does not know exactly how to
        court Ygwelve, so he has been following the Hodiri way,
        demonstrating his skills at riding, hunting, and warfare. He
        has received just enough encouragement from her to continue
        with his pursuit.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Looking for a Special Horse:">
      PCs are in need of a
      horse with certain characteristics, a particular color,
      size, temperament etc. Brynn is recommended as the man who
      can find it for them.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Insult:">
      Whether on purpose or by accident, one of
      the PCs has offered a grave insult to Brynn. Normally such
      things are settled violently by ritual combat, but he is
      willing to settle in a civilized manner, as soon as one of
      his friends will explain what that may be.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Horse Race:">
      Horse racing is an attraction at most large fairs and
      tournaments. Brynn has a very fast horse. A PC may be in the
      race. Someone might not like loosing money when that
      &quot;barbarian&quot; wins. PCs may be sent to
      &quot;educate&quot; him about his betters.

      <p>
        The second son of Lord Ertus of Narmas Manor in Lynnfana
        Hundred, Garin Ertus is a Matakea (Priest) at Halaina
        Abbey. He is young to be a priest, just 24 years old, having
        joined the church as a novice at fourteen. A very intense
        child, his father supported his decision, over the
        objections of his mother. By age sixteen, he was made an
        acolyte, finally taking his vows as a priest at twenty. A
        skilled debater, he is an intelligent and politically savvy
        young man. He has risen to the position of personal
        secretary and protégé of the Abbot. Some believe he could
        be the next abbot or (one day) Rekela.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Abbot has appointed Garin as acting Chaplain to the
        Earl of Vemion for his trip to Olokand. The son of a
        knight, Garin spent two years in Minarsas as a page. He is
        quite familiar (and comfortable) with the workings of the
        court and is well known and liked by the Earl and his
        family. His position gives him considerable access to the
        Earl's inner circle, a privilege he is careful not to
        abuse. A dedicated priest, he holds regular services and
        will &quot;forcefully remind&quot; any Laranians who don't
        attend of the danger to their soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        Garin believes that Laranian priests must emulate their
        martial deity. During his training at the Abbey, he drilled
        regularly with the Menoran and visiting members of the Lady
        of Paladins. He is a skilled swordsman, though he has not
        yet been in real combat. He wanted to wear a mail hauberk,
        but was dissuaded by the Abbot, who felt it would be out of
        place in the entourage. They compromised on a discrete
        leather jack he wears under his robes. If combat is
        expected, he will try and acquire at least a plate half-helm
        and knight shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other members of the entourage generally refer to him as
        Matakea Garin. Of noble birth, he has more latitude than
        most in dealing with superiors (with the exception of the
        Earl). He may act familiar to inferiors; they may not
        reciprocate. He seems to get along well with Squire Uldis
        and Master Miris, the two youngest nobles. Recognising that
        Yeoman Enil is considerably out of his depth, Garin has
        taken him under his wing.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Alamirata:">
      The Laranian clergy celebrate high mass
      every five days beginning on the second day of the
      month. While visiting a secular location, Matakea Garin
      decides to ride to a nearby abbey to attend the service. The
      PCs are assigned to escort him.

      <p>
        Both Worin's mother and father are servants. When he was old
        enough, he began to help out, fetching water and firewood,
        cleaning and doing small tasks. As he grew, he was given
        more responsibility. For the last ten years he has been a
        full time groom. He is responsible for taking care of his
        master's horses, including mucking-out (cleaning) the
        stables and feeding, exercising and grooming the horses
        under the direction of the ostler. His ambition is to join
        the ostler's guild and oversee the stable one
        day. Unfortunately, he is not the brightest
        fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Easily identified by his bright red hair, Worin is well
        known by the chamberlain and other servants. He is not
        very intelligent and easily tricked. Inevitably, when he
        discovers he has been duped, he will to lash out with his
        fists. Despite tending towards the &quot;flailing arms and
        blind luck&quot; school of unarmed combat, he is actually
        a good fighter. He usually loses only when he is
        outnumbered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deep down, Worin is a good person and wants to be
        liked. For those who discover this, such as Romont, he can
        be a fiercely loyal friend. Because of his loyalty, Worin
        is rarely alone, which can be helpful when his big mouth
        gets him into a bar fight. Older, wiser and more mature,
        Romont acts as a check on Worin's wilder urges. The
        Chamberlain has noted this and assigned the two to work
        together. They now spend most of their work and leisure
        time together. Worin has a limited vocabulary. When he
        runs out of words, he tends to use the phrase &quot;I will
        fong you!&quot; to express his frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worin spends most of his working day with the horses. He
        feeds them and grooms them in the morning; then he saddles
        or harnesses them for the day's activities. At each stop, he
        checks the horse's hoofs for stones and their legs for
        injuries. He leads them to water and prepares their feed. At
        the end of the day, he removes the saddles and , rubs them
        down and sets up the picket line for them to graze. Despite
        the care he lavishes on the horses, he only gets to ride
        when he exercising a horse, otherwise he walks with the rest
        of the servants. In the , he also helps with camp
        security. Since he is equipped only with a dagger and club,
        his job is to patrol the camp and call for help if he spots
        intruders.

      <p>
        The bastard son of a serving girl and a nobleman, Huw does
        not know for certain who his father is, though he has some
        strong suspicions. As a teenager, he was sent to Irtivir
        Abbey in northern Vemionshire where he received an excellent
        education. After completing his studies, he spent several
        years assisting the abbey's steward. The abbot's recommended
        Huw for the position of personal secretary to Sir Gorlin
        (the Earl of Vemion's chamberlain). Under the chamberlain's
        tutelage, Huw proved himself a skilled and loyal
        administrator with a knack for uncovering hidden
        facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 709TR, shortly after Sir Declaen became Earl of Vemion,
        Sir Gorlin recommended his protÃ©gÃ© for the important
        position of steward to the Earl's brother, Sir Rindan (the
        Royal Ostler), in Tashal. Huw is responsible for the Caldeth
        townhouse1 and a number of rental properties in the
        capital. He is also one of the Earl's agents and acts as
        another pair of eyes and ears, keeping his liege well
        informed on the activities in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Huw met his future wife, Ortilla, when they were
        teenagers. She was the daughter of one of Irtivir Abbey's
        reeves. They fell madly in love. The abbot, at first
        opposed to the match, changed his mind after consulting
        the Earl's herald. They have two children, twin daughters
        Doria and Dalya (21 year old). Both are attending Irtivir
        Abbey courtesy of the Sir Gorlin's patronage, &quot;It is
        the least I can do for my finest protégé&quot;. When Sir
        Gorlin travels north with the Earl, he always visits the
        abbey to check on the girls' progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The steward is well known and respected across Vemionshire,
        in the Earl's court in Minarsas and in the influential
        circles of Tashal. His strong personality, air of authority
        and brisk, alert manner, make him stand out. Some say he
        resembles an intelligent fox, with a sharp twitching nose
        and a stiff gray moustache that bristles fiercely across his
        sunken cheeks. Few are foolish enough to underestimate his
        cunning or loyalty to the Earl.
      </p>

      One of the Earl's Tashal ten-ants
      is behind on the rent. The steward has had enough of their
      excuses and hires the PCs to either collect the back rent
      (in full, with interest) or evict them (forcibly, if
      neces-sary). Huw has hired them rather than do it himself
      be-cause the tenants are connected to the Lia Kavair.

      Doria and Dalya are due to

      Abbey and escort the girls and their tutor/priest back to
      Tashal via Nenda Keep and the Selene River. The Lia Kavair
      have other plans.

      <p>
        Ortilla Islwyn is a tough, determined woman. The daughter of
        one of the reeves of Irtivir Abbey, she was quite attractive
        when she was young, but age and a hard life have dimmed her
        fine features. She met her future husband when she was just
        a teen and they fell madly in love. She later followed him
        to Minarsas where she worked in the kitchen as a cook. They
        have two children, twin daughters, both of whom are
        attending the Irtivir Abbey School in Vemionshire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the townhouse (see note 1) has only a small
        complement of servants, everyone has multiple jobs. Ortilla
        is the head domestic, cook, baker and alewife. She has four
        servants under her command, two chambermaids/washerwomen and
        two labourers/stablehands. Normally, she only has to take
        care of Sir Rindan, the Royal Ostler, so she isn't too
        busy. Most of her time is spent supervising the regular
        cleaning and maintenance of the large townhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from her supervisory and kitchen duties, Ortilla likes
        to purchase much of the household's food herself. Each
        morning, she will take a couple of the servants and go to
        the market. Ortilla knows Tashal extremely well. She is on a
        first name basis with many of the shopkeepers and guildsmen
        and always knows where to go to find the best quality and
        price on just about anything. She dresses neatly, but
        plainly. She knows that if she appears too well off, the
        prices will be doubled. For formal functions, she has fine
        dresses to match her husband, Huw.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hard life has also sharpened her tongue and given her a
        strong back and arms from lifting cauldrons and cutting
        meat. Five years ago, a thief broke into the townhouse. He
        learned the hard way that Ortilla's skill with a cleaver
        extends beyond butchering pigs. It took the chambermaids
        several days to clean up all the blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note 1: See the Caldeth Townhouse article, available at

        townhouse and staff.

    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Hostess.">
      Ortilla has been the senior woman in the
      household since her master'S wife died. She meets guests
      (PCs) and sees to their requirements. A commoner, she is
      quite comfortable dealing with even senior nobles.

      As senior woman of the household, Ortilla
      is second only to her husband within the household and
      fulfils many of the tasks normally undertaken by a
      chamberlain. She will not hesitate to task PC servants,
      men-at-arms and commoners, no matter their master. Those who
      are slow to obey will feel her wrath.

      <p>
        Terje has been the Earl of Vemion's falconer for 26 years; a
        position he inherited from his father. He raids nests for
        eggs; imprints, hand-raises and trains the chicks. The earl
        is pleased to have one of the most skilled falconers in the
        shire in his employ. He provides Terje with a generous
        income and a large house next to the mews.
      </p>
      <p>
        A widower since the death of his wife last winter, Terje has
        three adult children. All are married with families of their
        own. He has spent ten years teaching his son everything he
        knows. Over the past year, Terje has delegated more and
        more, even letting the young man take the earl hawking for a
        week on his own (with the earl's prior approval, of
        course). Then, a few months ago, Terje heard the angelic
        voice of a harper singing songs of the endless horizons and
        freedom of the sea. Now, he can't stop thinking about
        walking away from his boring, predictable life and doing
        something he wants to do: see the ocean, smell the fresh
        salt air and hear the sea gulls' cries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The falconer has a secret that can turn his dream into
        reality. In 718 while looking for falcon nests, he tripped
        over a root. His knee hit the ground; there was a crack, the
        ground caved in and revealed a buried treasure chest. Inside
        were 50 Khuzan gold coins, a mail shirt and shortsword. The
        chest was rotten but the sword and shirt were rust
        free. Terje never revealed his find to anyone, not even his
        own family. With his wife dead, his children grown up and
        his son ready and anxious to replace him, Terje has decided
        to take his treasure and disappear. The Earl's Progress
        offers the ideal chance to travel to Tashal and then, when
        the opportunity presents itself, slip quietly away, find a
        caravan and head to the sea. Any sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terje is a sturdy fellow, hardened by a lifetime in the
        outdoors. He has a ruddy complexion and large moustache. He
        has traveled regularly with his liege and has a good working
        knowledge of the southern half of the kingdom. The sword,
        shirt and coins are concealed in the false bottom of his
        travelling chest. Both items have Jmorvi enchantments that
        give them three additional levels of quality and permanent
        resistance to rust.
      </p>

      In payment for a successful
      job, the PCs are given a map to a great hoard.  When they go
      to retrieve it, they discover the chest has already been
      plundered. Dicreet inquiries reveal that the local falconer
      gave each of his daughters a dowry of two gold coins in
      718TR.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="What's He Doing?">
      Late one evening when everybody is
      asleep, the PCs see the falconer removing a false bottom
      from his travelling chest and transferring several objects
      into a backpack. The objects include a heavy leather
      satchel, a chain mail shirt and a sword.

      <p>
        A true Vemionshireman through and through, Romont is
        laconic, clannish and suspicious of outsiders. An
        experienced teamster, he has been driving wagons and tending
        horses most of his adult life. A native of Sanic Manor, he
        earns his living transporting goods throughout the shire and
        occasionally beyond. His cargo is mostly bales of wool, but
        can also include grain, barrels of ale and wine, hay, and
        other goods. Romont is well known for his skill with a team
        and wagon and is often entrusted with fragile cargo. He
        prides himself in keeping his wagon and horses in good
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a brawler, drinker and carouser, Romont has matured in
        the last few years. To the amazement of those who knew him
        in his youth, he is now older and wiser. He takes the time
        to think before acting and (surprisingly) is often the voice
        of reason among his peers. He still likes the occasional
        fistfight, flagon of ale and saucy wench, but in
        moderation. Most of the fights he gets into these days are
        helping his good friend Worin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Romont is well known as a loyal and trustworthy teamster. He
        has to be. The bales of wool he transports are extremely
        valuable and often the target of theft. The son of a yeoman
        and member of the militia, he is well prepared and has often
        been called upon to fight off thieves and brigands. He
        carries a stout cudgel and dagger for fending off
        bandits. For maximum utility when doing heavy work, Romont
        wears simple peasant's clothes.

      The PCs are travelling down a main road. They

    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Bar Brawl.">
      Worin is running off at the mouth, despite
      Romont's best efforts to stop him. He insults the PCs and a
      fight breaks out. Romont comes to his friend's aid against
      the PCs. He will not draw a weapon unless the PCs do first
      and then he will only try to defend himself until he can
      flee, dragging Worin with him.

      Romont is travelling in the same direction
      as the PCs. He has just dropped off a load of cargo and
      offers a good price to haul the PCs' goods to avoid
      travelling empty.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Smuggling.">
      Despite his squeaky clean image, Romont is
      actually a smuggler for the Lia-Kavair. He has a false
      bottom under his seat and transports illegal drugs from
      Vemionshire to Tashal several times a year. He offers to
      carry the PCs' goods at cut-rate prices. He gets arrested
      and the PCs' belongings get seized as well.

        Pelyn is originally from Heroth and was trained at the
        Harper's Hall in Aleath, Kanday. She has travelled widely
        since attaining her master status, visiting Shorkyne,
        Emelrene, Palithane and Trierzon before returning to
        Hârn. She learned many new songs and tales of strange and
        exotic lands previously unknown on Hârn. This puts her in
        high demand and allows her to command premium prices for her
        performances. She prefers the households of major nobles
        since they pay the best. Pelyn stays two to four months per
        household (or until her songs and tales no longer entertain)
        before moving on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pelyn has been travelling through eastern Hârn (Melderyn,
        Chybisa and Kaldor) for the last two years. Her feet are
        getting itchy and she is planning to head west, perhaps back
        to Kanday to see her family, with whom she has had no
        contact in 12 years. An experienced traveller, little
        surprises her anymore. She has been robbed, assaulted,
        propositioned and touched more times than she can
        count. Money and common possessions can be replaced, but she
        will fight hard (but not to the death) to protect her
        beautiful handcrafted Trierzi 21-string harp. Thankfully,
        she has never been raped. If she thinks a man might be
        harbouring ill thoughts towards her, she gleefully explains
        (in excruciating detail) that she has seven geldings to her
        credit (and they weren't horses).
      </p>
      <p>
        An attractive woman, Pelyn is smart, sassy and can hold her
        own in any bar brawl. She is dangerous with a knife and has
        the voice of an angel. One reason she is so popular is that
        she knows everything from refined love songs for the nobles
        to rowdy dirty ditties for the servants and soldiers and can
        shift styles in a heartbeat to cater to the crowd. Although
        a guild member, she is equally comfortable with nobles and
        commoners alike. She is always very well dressed.
      </p>

    <note type="hook" value="Do You Feel Lucky?">
      One of the PCs gets a little too
      familiar with the harper. The next thing he knows, he has a
      razor sharp dagger against his testicles and the harper is

      will be like.

    <note type="hook" value="Travel Information.">
      The PCs are planning a trip to a
      distant location. In her performance, Pelyn makes reference
      to having been there. If the PCs approach her seeking more
      information, she is more than happy to oblige ... for a
      price.

      Pelyn is not from Heroth; she is from Shiran,

      <p>
        Twenty-three, Esar is old for an apprentice. The son of a
        poor day labourer he is well aware that his master, Ostler
        Donar of Harabor [Minarsas page 11], has no intention of
        making him a journeyman. Esar has decided that as an
        apprentice, he is little better than a serf. If he wants
        things to change, he has to make his own future. His luck
        turned the day he was assigned to tend to the Earl of
        Minarsas' brother-in-law, Sir Andro Valador. Esar's quick
        obedience, deference and almost painful desire to please
        stroked the ego of the vain bailiff. Soon, Esar was doing
        &quot;special&quot; jobs on the side for the knight,
        including reporting on the comings and goings in both
        Minarsas castle and the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esar is bought and paid for. He has secretly sworn
        allegiance to Sir Andro in return for the promise of a
        position in his household. Esar is clever, strong and brave;
        he has to be to risk life and limb tending warhorses. On
        many occasions, he has broken up battling stallions, showing
        a self-confidence that the horses can sense. However, he has
        yet to kill a man. He would do so if Sir Andro ordered, but
        his conscience would likely betray him afterwards, as he is
        a pious (if lapsed) Peonian. Esar wears a padded leather
        tunic, which offers some protection from a stallion's kick,
        and carries a solid but plain dagger, iron-shod staff and
        ox-hide whip.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Andro has evil plans for the Earl of Vemion. Esar is the
        obvious patsy and fall guy if things go wrong. Well aware of
        the risk, he will flee if things start to look bad. An
        excellent rider, Esar could be out of Kaldor in just a few
        days and be in another kingdom in a few weeks. After that,
        he could be encountered anywhere on Hârn.

      Esar has fled the Earl's
      service. He has sold the horses (the brands were a dead
      giveaway) and is looking for work. He would make a good
      horse groom, servant or retainer ... if you can trust
      him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Murderer.">
      The PCs have crossed Sir Andro Valador. He has dispatched
      Esar to &quot;deal&quot; with them. Esar will attempt to
      attack the PCs one at a time, preferably while they are
      sleeping or drunk. He may also try and befriend them so they
      let down their guard.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Whoa Boy.">
      A PC's horse goes crazy, bucks the PC off
      and is kicking and causing mayhem. Out of nowhere, Esar
      steps in. Within minutes, he has control of the horse and
      has calmed him down. There was a snake in the grass and the
      horse panicked. Esar is quite nonchalant about taming this
      wild horse but agrees to join the PCs for a flagon of ale if
      they offer.

      <p>
        Squire Uldis Harand is just nineteen. He is a tall, thin,
        awkward teenager, all hands and feet, but on horseback he is
        a different man. Mounted, Uldis is all ease and grace, an
        instinctive horseman and a magnificent rider. Some think he
        is a bit slow, but he is no fool. Quite grave and serious,
        he takes his time analysing problems, invariably arriving at
        the correct solution. He is a solid dependable friend, if a
        bit apt to look on the gloomy side of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Iswend Manor, Uldis is the third of four boys. There
        are few prospects for him at home. He was fortunate enough
        to be squired to a friend of his father's, Sir Lluwyn Haber,
        older brother of the Lord of Bevon Manor and a tournament
        knight of some renown. The knight has trained him well. He
        had such confidence in Uldis' skills that he paid for him to
        enter the Earl of Minarsas' tournament. His instincts were
        correct and Uldis won the squire's joust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his tournament victories, Uldis still has two years
        to go before being knighted. He will return to Sir Lluwyn's
        service as soon as possible to continue his training. Lluwyn
        knows that Uldis hopes to find service in the household of a
        baron or earl after he is knighted, so he encouraged the
        young man compete in the squire joust and then go with the
        Earl of Vemion to Olokand. Lluwyn knows that the contacts he
        makes on such a trip are his best chance of finding a
        permanent liege.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uldis is well equipped for a squire. He has the armor of a
        knight, one of his master's former conquests. To reduce the
        chances of losing his star pupil, Sir Lluwyn has provided
        Uldis with a quilt gambeson and arming cap, mail hauberk and
        cowl and plate half-helm from his extensive collection of
        tournament trophies.
      </p>
      <p class="Acknowledgement">
        Thanks to my good friend Jeremy Baker for his Bevon Manor
        article and the character of Sir Lluwyn, the
        &quot;playful&quot; tournament knight.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Fellow Traveller.">
      Uldis was slightly injured at the
      Olokand tournament and the physician advised he wait two
      weeks before travelling back to Vemionshire. Now healed,
      Squire Uldis is looking for a group (such as the PCs) who
      are going in the right direction to travel with.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Point of Honour.">
      He prefers the terms staid and deliberate, but some people
      (such as the PCs) make the mistake of thinking Uldis is
      &quot;slow&quot;. He takes offence to their comments and
      challenges one of them to a &quot;friendly&quot; bout with
      rebated swords (to first hit on the torso).
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="New Master.">
      Sir Lluwyn has been called away on urgent
      business and can't take Uldis with him. He knows one of the
      PC knights and asks him to take over the squire's training
      until he gets back.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Sir Tarris Drelican is the lord of Ontes Manor (in Atressa
        Hundred), a friend of the Earl of Vemion and one of his
        favourite hunting companions. Sir Tarris' wife died giving
        birth to their only child, his son Miris (nicknamed Kit,
        short for kitten, by his mother). Fourteen, Miris should
        have been fostered to another noble family by now, first as
        a page and then as a squire. Sir Tarris bucked tradition and
        kept him home for two reasons. First, he is the spitting
        image of his mother and Sir Tarris could not bear to be
        separated from his beloved son and reminder of his dearly
        departed wife. Second, Miris is (to put it discretely and
        delicately) somewhat effeminate and Sir Tarris has to
        constantly protect him from bullying by other boys. He hopes
        to find a knight willing to accept his son as his squire;
        Miris is also looking for a knight in shining armor, but
        not for the reasons his father hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miris Drelican is a pretty boy. His father holds a rich
        manor and indulges his every wish. Despite this, Miris is
        not whiney or spoilt; in fact he is generous and
        outgoing. He does tend to be a bit foppish, wearing only the
        most fashionable clothing. His father has begun teaching him
        the fighting arts, which he doesn't find very
        interesting. One thing he does love is climbing and
        tumbling. Two winters ago, a juggler and contortionist spent
        several months at Ontes. Since then, Miris has been obsessed
        with flips, rolls and outrageous feats of acrobatics. His
        dream is to run off and become an acrobat. He loves and
        respects his father and knows it would break his heart, so
        he has resigned himself to becoming a knight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of their fathers' friendship, Miris and Camissa
        have started to become friends. She is well aware of his
        lack of sexual interest in her, but enjoys his company. He
        has an uncanny ability to make her laugh. Sir Tarris often
        reprimands his son for being overly familiar with his
        liege's daughter and chastises him for acting the fool
        with tumbling and antics more suited to &quot;common
        entertainers&quot;. Fortunately, the knight's obvious love
        and affection for his son take the bite out of his words
        and everyone knows that they are only for form's sake.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Pretty Boy.">
      The PCs come upon Miris surrounded by
      several teenage boys.  They are taunting and hitting him,
      accusing him of being a &quot;girl&quot;. If the PCs rescue him, Sir
      Tarris will be extremely grateful and a valuable ally.
      Miris will develop a crush on the male PC with the highest
      comeliness and become his constant &quot;shadow&quot;.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Mouse.">
      Miris has an insatiable curiosity, incredible
      climbing skills and the ability to worm his way through the
      smallest of openings. The PCs may find this
      useful.

      <p>
        Yeoman Enil Peryne is the classic fish out of water. He has
        never left Vemionshire and only visited Minarsas three
        times, despite the fact that he comes from Zoben Keep just a
        short walk away. A brilliant short bowman, Constable Coreth
        Lothlar convinced him to participate in the archery
        tournament because he could win a large cash prize
        (60d). Enil was horrified when he discovered that he was
        expected to go to Olokand with the Earl. He is completely
        lost among so many high-ranking people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different people react to stress differently. In a normal,
        calm social environment, Enil is a complete country bumpkin,
        tongue-tied with two left feet. He stammers, bows a lot and
        tries to be invisible. He completely defers to anyone of
        higher rank. This all changes completely in combat or when
        he is shooting his bow. It is almost as if another
        personality appears. He enters a trance like state and he
        becomes a pure killing machine. He is cool, calm and
        collected. Enil's eagle vision lets him spot enemies and
        make the most ridiculous shots look easy. As soon as combat
        or the competition is over, he completely loses his cool and
        needs constant reassurance that he did ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matakea Garin Ertus has taken Enil under his wing. He
        tells him where to go, where to sleep and what to do. Enil
        is thankful for this structure and clear
        direction. Anytime someone else tells him to do something,
        he will look to the Matakea for approval. Some have taken
        to referring to him as &quot;The Matakea's Shadow&quot;. A
        father of six, Enil has been happily married for fifteen
        years. He will be the first to admit his wife runs things,
        but he likes it that way. A good farmer, he has a large
        comfortable house with archery butts in the garden. He
        practices every day, even while traveling.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Your New Best Friend.">
      One of the PCs is nice to
      Enil. He responds by becoming the PC's new best
      friend. Although he can be a little needy, he is a good
      friend to have in a pinch.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Who's Afraid of Enil?">
      Enil is part of a party that
      has been sent after the PCs. They observe him from a
      distance and get the distinct impression he is a joke. He
      seems bewildered and overwhelmed by events and not much of a
      threat. When they engage in combat, they find out the
      opposite when he pins several PCs to a building with arrows
      through their clothes.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Yes, Sir.">
      The PCs need some extra firepower. A friend
      recommends taking Enil. He seems an unlikely retainer,
      scraping and bowing. In the first fight, the PCs realise why
      their friend recommended him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="GM Suggestion:">
      For best effect, play up Enil's simpleton, fish-out-of-water
      persona. Only reveal his awesome combat skills in the first
      skirmish. Then, have him asking everyone, &quot;Did I do ok?
      Was that what you wanted?&quot;

      <p>
        A Member of Morgal's Rangers. In 712TR, Sir Morgal Rintaran
        created an elite force of skilled hunters and woodsmen,
        personally trained and well equipped. Dubbing the group his
        Rangers, their mission is emergency response to fire, injury
        or other calamity in the vast forests surrounding the Earl
        of Vemion's holdings. The Rangers are handpicked freemen and
        serfs from Vemionshire [Minarsas 29]. Lavro is from Onris
        Manor, just northwest of the Ranger base at Erthen. He has
        been a member of the Rangers since their creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wealthy villein, Lavro owns many sheep and has a large
        extended family including three sons. Now that his sons are
        in their twenties, Lavro feels comfortable putting them in
        charge of the farm and going off for long periods of
        time. Since his wife died two years ago, Lavro has
        volunteered for several extended stints with the Rangers. A
        lifelong shepherd, he is well experienced at tracking down
        lost animals and killing wolves and foxes with his bow. He
        is an expert tracker and crack shot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Morgal knows Lavro well and considers him one of his
        foremost scouts. He frequently chooses him for missions
        requiring quick thinking and independent action. Because of
        this, Lavro is used to travelling and working with
        nobles. He was handpicked to escort the Earl to Baseta
        Keep. Sir Morgal has arranged with the Bailiff of Onris for
        him to be gone for several months. In addition, the
        Constable has given the scout a warrant signed and sealed by
        the Earl of Vemion himself stating that Lavro is travelling
        on his business and with his leave. Although he can't read
        it, Lavro is well aware of the effect the document has on
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        An experienced traveller, Lavro has been to Qualdris and
        Kolorn with the Earl. Tashal is big, but does not intimidate
        him. If anything, the big, tough villein may be a bit
        overconfident. He believes that the warrant from the Earl
        will get him out of any problem with the law, something that
        is not really true.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Eyes and Ears.">
      Lavro is the eyes and ears of the
      group. He ranges ahead, looking out for brigands. He comes
      back with word of an ambush ahead. He volunteers to take the
      PCs and attack the ambushers from behind. Can the PCs keep
      up with this skilled woodsman?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Poachers.">
      PCs are notorious for not obeying the
      rules. They have been poaching in the forest. Lavro leads a
      group of Rangers determined to arrest them.

    <note type="hook" value="The Woodsman.">
      The PCs are hired to wipe out a gargun
      swarm in the area. They need additional men. Lavro offers to
      help, with his Bailiff's permission.

        Bascal didn't start out as a physician he was originally an
        alchemist. As time went on it became clear that he was
        making more money healing people than he was in turning lead
        to gold. Gradually, alchemy became more and more of a hobby
        he did in his spare time and medicine became his primary
        focus. His skill with making powdered mineral compounds to
        settle the angry stomach and herbs to make poultices earned
        him a very good reputation. His popularity was his
        downfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six years ago, a servant came to fetch him for a house
        call. The child of a powerful and wealthy lord was ill. The
        minute he saw the child he knew she was doomed. Her eyes
        were sunken and her breathing was weak. He tried to retreat,
        but the lord drew his sword and demanded he save her. Bascal
        tried everything, but by morning she was dead. Her father
        went wild, destroying the house. While the servants tried to
        restrain him, Bascal was able to slip away. He hoped he
        would be forgotten in the lord's grief, but just in case,
        Bascal took the precaution of staying with a friend, a wise
        move.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day there was a warrant for his arrest for the
        murder of the young girl. His business was seized and his
        house ransacked. With the help of his friends, he was able
        to flee the city, but with only the clothes on his back, his
        medical kit and a few coins his friends had been able to
        spare. Since that time he has been on the run. The lord has
        gone mad with grief; hiring bounty hunters to find Bascal
        and bring him back to be tortured on the rack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the threat of discovery, Bascal has been forced
        to work in back alleys and deal with criminals. He hates his
        life and wants some stability and a place to reestablish a
        normal existence.

      <p>
        Bjarr was born to a minor retainer of Clan Baelin in
        Altenhus, Menglana. Like his father, he became a Huscarl at
        age 16. In 698TR, he was sent with an expedition to collect
        overdue tribute. Combat ensued. During the battle, Bjarr
        came face to face with a veteran huscarl. He was overmatched
        and a blow severed his left arm between the wrist and
        elbow. Fighting on, he blinded his opponent with the
        spurting blood and killing him with an axe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although severely injured, Bjarr's bravery was credited with
        breaking the line and winning the battle. Quick thinking by
        one of his companions cauterised the wound with red-hot
        steel. After several weeks' recovery, Bjarr was shocked to
        discover the valhakar was dismissing him from his service
        because he was now missing a hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, Bjarr's heroism was brought to the attention of
        the local Sarajinian priest, a member of Clan Aymen. He
        agreed to adopt the young man and train him as a
        cleric. After several years of training, the old priest
        trusted him enough to reveal a carefully guarded secret; he
        was a Runemaster, able to divine the future. Impressed with
        Bjarr's dedication, courage and powerful spiritual abilities
        he had decided to pass on his skills to Bjarr.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 708TR, just as Bjarr was really beginning to make
        progress, his master came into conflict with the Clan Baelin
        supported Order of the Pillar of Fire. Three weeks later,
        the priest was killed in the street. Bjarr only barely
        escaped with his life. He fled, first to Aymen clanhouse in
        Vulenheim. Unfortunately, the Agrikans in Altenhus sent word
        to their temple there and he was forced to flee
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        After several years moving from temple to temple in
        Menglana, he finally decided to immigrate to Orbaal. After a
        short while there, he decided to strike out again and see
        more of Hârn. He has some money, but he depends on the
        charity of Sarajin temples or the money he earns divining
        the future with his runes. He has a burning hatred of
        Agrikans.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="A Common Foe.">
      The PCs are planning an action against
      Agrikans. Bjarr hears tell of this and comes to offer his
      assistance. The GM may use his runecasting skill to direct
      the PCs in a specific direction.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Foreign Witch.">
      Short of funds, Bjarr tried to use
      runecasting to earn some money. One of the locals doesn't
      like his predictions and denounces him as a witch. Only
      steps ahead of the mob, he begs the PCs to hide him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Guide.">
      The PCs are travelling to Orbaal and need a
      guide/translator. Bjarr offers his services. The runes tell
      him there is something important about one of the
      PCs.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Bolgar was born in a little village two days to the north of
        Golotha; he was the fifth son in a family of eight. Seeing
        no future as a farmer, he ran away soon after his eighteenth
        birthday. He made for Golotha as so many before
        him. However, freedom can be hard and he had a difficult
        time supporting himself. Eventually he was forced to steal
        to survive. The Lia-Kaviar did not like his intrusion, so he
        was given a warning. The scar across is right, unseeing eye
        is a memory from this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left for dead, he survived, crawling down and hiding in the
        darkness under the quays. He spent a long time alone,
        healing his wounds. During this time, his mental health
        deteriorated. When he had recovered enough, he found work as
        a ratter and survives on his meagre income and the rare alms
        given to the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having survived the streets of Golotha for more than twenty
        years, he is well known in the underworld, though few really
        know anything about him. He is considered a bit mad, but
        harmless and most people leave him alone. Those who have
        tried to rob him have gotten a taste of his staff. Bolgar
        still lives under the quays, sleeping in different spots
        from night to night. He knows the ins and outs of all
        Golotha's sewers and canals.
      </p>
      <p>
        A little mad, Bolgar enjoys talking to himself and the
        people he perceives around him. He is harmless and kind, but
        a loner trapped in his own world. He is talkative but has a
        fairly limited attention span.
      </p>
      <p>
        A weathered and crumbled man in his late forties, Bolgar's
        hair and beard are long, greasy and grey. He has a large
        scar crossing his unseeing right eye and not many teeth left
        in his mouth. His cheeks are sunken; he looks haggard and
        walks with a gait. Bolgar is dressed in dirty rags collected
        over the years. He carries everything he owns with him, so
        an assortment of bits and pieces hangs from his belt and
        around his neck. His staff is usually decorated with the
        latest catch. A little mangy, flea ridden Trierzi terrier
        accompanies him everywhere.

      <p>
        Canutulachama (which means Canut the long legged) is well
        known among the Kath peoples that live on Kaldor's
        borders. At six feet, he is exceptionally tall for a Kath
        male, but he moves quietly with great precision and economy
        of movement. He has a medium frame and weighs about 170
        pounds. He is swarthy and attractive in appearance, with
        brown hair, beard and bright hazel eyes. Canut has the habit
        of constantly changing his gaze, making eye contact with
        everyone around him again and again, in rapid succession. He
        wears the traditional clothing of his people, including the
        finely tanned grey hide of a lone wolf, known as a lobo. In
        a twelve day ritual, Canut hunted him down, finally
        cornering him against a cliff and killing him with just a
        dagger. The shaman proudly bears the claw marks on his chest
        and back from the single combat. He carries the wolf's claws
        and teeth in a pouch around his neck. It is considered
        sacred and he will reveal its contents to no one.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is Kath tradition, Canut lives apart from the tribe,
        travelling freely, a true nomad. The oldest of four
        children, he was chosen by his mentor to be trained in the
        way of the shaman when he was sixteen. Now thirtythree, he
        is considering choosing an apprentice to teach his secrets
        to. These secrets include an amazing knowledge of herbs and
        medicine which he uses in drugenhanced magic rituals. During
        the rituals, he will often not sleep for five or six
        days. Afterwards he appears very tired, haggard and somewhat
        wild. If the vision moves him, he will pack up and travel
        great distances with no warning. These travels have taken
        him outside of the normal Kath range on numerous occasions
        in search of a place or a person the spirits have sent him
        to meet.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The only son of the master ostler in Techen, Rethem, Dersory
        is the third child and the favourite. His mother is dead and
        his father has remarried. His father, the clanhead and a
        wealthy guildsman, saw to it that he had everything he
        wanted growing up. As a result, the already short Dersory
        also grew up overweight. Moderately manic-depressive, he
        goes through periods of frantic activity (which are
        frequently highly profitable), followed by periods of
        depression, self-doubt and self-isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Living close to border, he frequently travels to Tharda to
        trade horses. He has gone as far as Trobridge Inn to buy
        from the Chelni. A fine judge of horses and a good
        negotiator, he makes an excellent living buying, selling
        and breeding horses. &quot;Flexible&quot; morals mean he
        will not ask awkward questions about the ownership of a
        horse, if the price is right. He is equally uninterested
        in who wants to buy his horses, so long as they have
        enough silver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Married with several children, Dersory's motivations are
        wealth and personal pleasure. Despite his short stature and
        obesity, he is still attractive; he has a full purse and a
        strong appetite for pretty young girls. He regularly cheats
        on his wife and has three mistresses in various
        cities. Dersory makes little effort to hide his
        activities. His meek, obedient wife says nothing, devoting
        herself to her children and the Peonian Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Dersory is in one of his manic phases, he is a cruel
        and demanding taskmaster, working his apprentices and
        journeyman into the ground without mercy. These periods are
        followed by long lulls where he doesn't talk to them at
        all. His wife and his journeyman, Barin, run the franchise
        during these periods. Although he is still young and
        inexperienced, Barin has managed to embezzle a significant
        sum from his master over the last two years.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="We Need Horses.">
      The PCs need horses. Dersory happens
      to be driving a herd of horses to market. He offers to sell
      the PCs as many as they need, at a great price, but buyer
      beware; they have Red Shadows of Herpa brands.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Thieving Bastard.">
      Finally aroused from his latest
      depression, Dersory stayed up all night checking the books
      and discovered Barin's embezzlement.  The journeyman has
      fled, but Dersory is willing to pay handsomely to have time
      back. He offers the PCs a generous bounty.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Blackmail.">
      Dersory has recently discovered that he
      can sometimes hear what other people are thinking. He picks
      up something about the PCs recent activities and decides to
      blackmail them. He comes up with a plausible, but mundane,
      cover story to explain how he knows.

      <p>
        Droun was born in Cherafir, the fifth child of the local
        shipwright. His childhood was very happy. He was expected to
        become a shipwright, but unlike his siblings, Droun never
        felt the calling. At fourteen, he was fostered out to a
        shipwright in Thay. Loyally, he trained hard, doggedly
        learning the necessary skills. After completing his
        apprenticeship in 704 TR, he departed on his journeyman
        travels. As required, he worked in various shipyards,
        acquiring four (of the twelve) approvals required to become
        a master shipwright.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 706 TR he encountered a Trierzi master mason repairing a
        dry dock where he toiled unhappily. The two became friends
        despite their difference in age. Droun reveal his deep
        unhappiness in becoming a shipwright. The mason encouraged
        him to pray on his dilemma. After several weeks of soul
        searching, Droun decided to quit his job at the shipyard and
        try something new. The mason invited Droun to join on his
        next project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Droun's existing skills proved a great asset and he was soon
        in charge of scaffold construction. Within six months he
        discovered that he wanted to build monuments to withstand
        the tide of years. Finally, in stone, he had discovered his
        calling. Inspired by his friend's passion, the mason
        sponsored Droun, taking him as an apprentice. He proved to
        be a natural, absorbing everything the mason could teach him
        with great ease. Within three years, he was the supervisor
        of tracery and statuary. By 713 TR, he completed
        apprenticeship and became a journeyman.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 718 TR, he was made a master free mason. Overjoyed, he
        returned home to Cherafir for the first time since 704
        TR. There, he received a chilly reception. His family feared
        him dead, or worse, that he had failed his journeyman's
        requirements and was too ashamed to come home. His father
        was furious that Droun had abandoned the family trade. He
        wasn't thrown out, but he was invited to leave,
        immediately. He is now a travelling mason.

      <p>
        Every wealth household has people like Gathric, a sturdy,
        hardworking servant. He has worked in the same house since
        he was sixteen, fetching water, cutting firewood, carrying
        parcels and escorting his mistress in her daily forays into
        town. His size and skill with a club make him a formidable
        escort for his employers and he can often be seen carrying a
        load of goods for them during the day or a torch during the
        night. He is also the jack-of-alltrades handyman, repairing
        broken items around the house. He sleeps in the kitchen near
        the fire and is a light sleeper waking at the slightest
        sound. His cudgel is always close at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second of five children, Gathric went to live with his
        maternal grandfather after his mother died and his father
        remarried. Twelve years old at the time, he and his
        stepmother hated each other openly, which made him unpopular
        with his father. His grandfather taught him to sing and play
        the drums. He is good enough that he is sometimes invited to
        sing and play at the local tavern.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he turned sixteen, his grandfather found him a job as a
        servant where he has worked for the last eleven years. A big
        lad, five foot nine inches with a heavy frame he weighs
        173lbs. His fair complexion, blond hair, hazel eyes and good
        looks are marred only by a broken nose and scars on his
        forehead he earned in a bar brawl. He is left handed and has
        rough calloused hands from regular heavy labour. He is kind
        and flirtatious with women, which has earned him a
        reputation as a ladies man and a girlfriend with an
        illegitimate baby daughter. He is careless, often not paying
        attention to his duties and is forgetful of the time. Since
        he was very young, Gathric has had the odd quirk of sneezing
        when he walks out into sunlight.

      <p>
        Gwyte is an experienced clothier and the patriarch of Clan
        Marath. A resident of Habe, Azadmere, his family have been
        making finely embroidered tunics and surcoats for five
        generations. Since the Khuzdul restrict access to Azadmere,
        he can charge high prices and earn substantial profits by
        reselling fine imported linen and woollen goods purchased
        from other clothiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there is no guild structure in Habe, Gwyte is a
        member of the clothier's guild. This allows him to buy
        directly from other clothiers during the caravan
        season. Members of the Tashal Mangai resent his easy access
        to the lucrative Azadmere market and this has strained his
        relationships with the other clothiers, especially Haber of
        Sarlis, who also exports to the mountain kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each spring, Gwyte and two or three clansmen take a string
        of mules and join one of the caravans heading down the
        Silver Way to Tashal. If they don't find what they are
        looking for among the caravans and other clothiers in
        Tashal, he will sometimes visit the Kaldoric countryside or
        range further a field, including visiting Burzyn and Thay to
        the south and Coranan and Shiran to the west.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Gwyte finds the type of cloth he needs, he purchases it
        in large quantities. When he leaves Habe he carries large
        usurers notes to pay for the goods and when he returns he
        has bulky but valuable cargos of goods. Since he does not
        have armed retainers of his own, he hires mercenaries to
        escort his caravan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, business has been good. Gwyte has taken his excess
        silver and purchased a house in Tashal. This will give him a
        permanent presence in the city and a place to warehouse his
        goods until they can be moved to Habe. The other clothiers
        are not too happy with this idea. They may try to sabotage
        the house or intimidate his staff.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Unique Insight.">
      Few humans get to visit
      Azadmere. Gwyte is one of a select few who deal regularly
      with Kaldor. The PCs patron wants them to meet with him and
      discuss ways of opening up trade.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Pre-emptive Raid.">
      Several guildsmen are planning a
      large and valuable caravan. They are worried about a gargun
      attack from Fana. Gwyte wants to hire the PCs to lead two
      mercenary companies in a pre-emptive raid to occupy the
      gargun while the caravan passes.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="An Honest Job.">
      Gwyte needs agents to represent his
      interests in Kaldor, including buying and selling goods and
      escorting caravans. The job will be busy during the caravan
      season, but very flexible the rest of the year. It includes
      room and board in his new Tashal townhouse.

      <p>
        Ondarn's parents were harpers and travelled
        extensively. When he was born, they left him with his aunt
        and uncle in Tashal until he was old enough to travel. As a
        result, he has a distinctive Kaldoric accent he has never
        been able to shake. Blessed with a strong voice and an
        excellent memory, Ondarn had little trouble learning his
        parents' repertoire of songs and folk tales. He accompanies
        his songs on the harp, his most valuable
        possession.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a five-year apprenticeship and a dozen years as a
        wandering bard, Ondarn was awarded the coveted title of
        Master Harper last year in Aleath, Kanday. His
        presentation of seven original works was well received by
        his assembled peers. He now intends to devote several
        years to roaming the isle in search of new tales. He
        dreams of one day visiting (or even attending) the
        &quot;Silver Lute Palace of Harpers&quot; in Elshavel,
        Evael.
      </p>
      <p>
        A slight, not particularly strong man, Ondarn has a
        distinct aversion to violence. He shuns weapons and is the
        first out the door (pay or no pay) when a fight breaks
        out. That being the case, he is often completely ignored
        as a harmless fop by the rich and powerful men who hire
        him. They discuss the most remarkable subjects under his
        very nose. Although he claims &quot;complete discretion is
        assured&quot; he is not above selling a particularly juicy
        bit of information for the right price. Often resulting in
        him being only one step ahead of angry former employers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although definitely not effeminate, Ondarn is bisexual. A
        flirt and a tease, he has an infallible ability to pick out
        someone (of either sex) who is attracted to him. If he is
        the least bit attracted to them, he will find a time and
        place to seduce and bed them. This has resulted in many
        hasty departures with fathers, husbands and brothers in hot
        pursuit. As a result, Ondarn has had to continually change
        his identity and move, so he may be found in any city, town
        or village under any of a dozen pseudonyms.
      </p>

    <note type="hook" value="Valuable Information:">
      The PCs need information but
      can't get it themselves. A contact suggests Ondarn could do
      it for them. He does, but then wants more money or he will
      reveal the PCs to the noble they are spying on.

    <note type="hook" value="A Matter of Honour:">
      Ondarn has taken the virginity of a prominent young man. His
      father is worried that if rumours of his son's

      willing to pay them more to help him get away.

      <p>
        Being the priest of a feudal religion in an imperial state
        is not easy, but challenges are nothing new for Rayald. Born
        a bastard, he is the second son of a Thardic
        senator. Although acknowledged by his father, he was denied
        his father's name and wealth enjoyed by his legitimate
        halfsiblings. The son of a jeweller's daughter, he never
        starved, but his conservative guildsman grandparents treated
        him like a burden and looked down on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was eighteen, Rayald decided he had no interest in
        becoming a jeweller. If he couldn't be a part of his
        father's family, the only other option was to enter the
        church. Despite being partially deaf and not the most
        athletic applicant, he was in the right place at the right
        time. The Laranian church was searching for converts among
        the senatorial class, and the bastard son of a senator was
        better than nothing. Once in the church, he proved a natural
        priest, spending the next five years at the Laranian temple
        in Coranan. There, he got plenty of opportunity to put his
        combat skills to the test in the constant low intensity
        warfare between the Laranians and the Agrikans.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing his acolyte training, Rayald travelled to
        Kanday as part of an exchange between temples. There, he saw
        feudal culture for the first time. Instantly enamoured by
        it, and freed for the first time of the stigma of being seen
        as a bastard first and a priest second, he blossomed. In
        reward for redoubling his efforts, he was ordained shortly
        thereafter. As a new priest, he was sent back to Tharda to
        spread the gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tharda is a difficult challenge. In an imperial state, there
        is little interest for a god that advocates
        feudalism. Agrikans, and even ordinary citizens, have been
        known to attack Laranians as they preach. Therefore, Rayald
        is always armed and wears a ring byrnie beneath his
        robes. He remains committed to recruiting new
        parishioners.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Sigyn was born in Orbaal, outside Arathel, a member of a
        minor Ivinian clan. An independent and strong willed woman,
        she never felt at ease in the patriarchal society of
        Orbaal. So, at an early age, she decided to run away. When
        she was fifteen years old, she bargained passage on a
        merchant ship bound for Golotha. Upon arrival, the
        unscrupulous captain of the ship drugged her and sold her
        into slavery. The slavers then resold her to House of the
        Five Pleasures in Golotha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to her beauty and exotic looks, Sigyn attracted the
        interest of many wealthy and influential customers before
        coming to the attention of the Halean Church. Sigyn was
        purchased, freed and made a corathar (acolyte). She was
        promoted to shenasene (priestess) a few years later. She
        has been a priestess for about a year. Sigyn is a popular
        priestess and retains some of her old
        &quot;clients&quot;. She loathes slavers and is planning
        her revenge on the captain who betrayed her and the
        slavers who resold her. She feels great gratitude towards
        the Order of the Silken Voice for buying her freedom and
        accepting her as a corathar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sigyn is a tease and often intrudes into people's personal
        space, flirting shamelessly with both men and women. She is
        not afraid to use her looks and sex appeal to get what she
        wants. A devout Halean and a shrewd bargainer, she hides her
        intelligence behind an easy-going and carefree
        attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 5 feet 8 inches, Sigyn is tall for a woman. She is well
        proportioned and has a very feminine figure. Her long blond
        hair reaches her waist and is slightly curly. Sparkling blue
        eyes glitter with mischief and vague promises. She has a
        beautiful face with full red lips and slightly accentuated
        cheekbones. Her dress is always revealing, accentuating her
        luscious bosom and hips. Sigyn favours scarlet and gold and
        the quality of her garments are always exquisite. She likes
        necklaces, armbands and bells and often wears an assortment
        of these, with the usual motifs of coins and stylised
        genitalia.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Honour of the Clan:">
      One of Sigyn's relatives
      approaches the PC's, asking them to find her and bring her
      back to her clan in Orbaal. He offers a substantial
      reward.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Revenge is a dish best served cold:">
      Sigyn has planned
      her revenge on the captain and/or slavers for a long

      to help her. One of her clients is funding the plan.

      shamelessly with them and invites them to take part in a

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Sir Egar is the third child of Sir Hurald of Olandau, the
        Bailiff of Rewellen. Rewellen is subordinate to his uncle's
        manor at Thisyn, held from the Earl of Techen. As the second
        son, Sir Egar was trained as knight and squired with the
        influential Bisidril clan at Vinarsa manor. A devout Agrikan
        and adventurous young man, he joined the Order of Warriors
        of Mamaka after his twentieth birthday. He began his career
        in the order at Bedenes as a Haragki (knight), fighting the
        Kubora. During this time he developed an intense hatred for
        the barbarians, reinforced by the massacre at Kustan. Sir
        Egar argues for a full-scale crusade against the heathens to
        cleanse the stain of dishonour from the shield of the
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early on, priests of the clerical order, Mamaka the Master
        of Steel, took an interest in Sir Egar, noting his religious
        devotion and ties with the powerful Bisidril clan. He was
        recruited and trained to become a Heruchai
        (priestlieutenant). The scheming and intrigue of priesthood
        was not to Sir Egar's liking. Soon after he was ordained, he
        transferred back to the Warriors of Mamaka. Sir Egar has
        served the order loyally for more than ten years and has
        reached the rank of Telmen (knight commander).
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the order he is considered a ruthless and fearless
        warrior and something of a religious fanatic, annoying the
        more secular members of the order with his constant
        preaching. He is a friend of Sir Zaurial Bisidril, whom he
        met as a squire at Vinarsa manor. The two warriors are
        brothers in arms and assist each other on
        occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Egar is a tall, heavy-set man in his mid thirties. His
        fiery red hair and battle scared face make him easy to
        remember. His water green eyes hide a sharp and ambitious
        intellect. He usually dresses in good quality clothing
        bearing the arms of the Warriors of Mamaka. He always
        carries his heavy bastard sword, as a symbol of his status
        and might. His bearing is noble and aloof. Any commoners in
        his path must move aside quickly or face his
        wrath.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Run in:">
      Sir Egar meets the PC's and takes an instant
      dislike to them. He singles them out for some bullying. He
      and his men taunt the PC's, trying to provoke a fight.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="On patrol:">
      The PC's encounter Sir Egar and some of
      his men looking for something/someone. The PC's are ordered
      to assist in the search.

    <note type="hook" value="Preaching:">
      Sir Egar is preaching Agrikan dogma,
      trying to inspire his men and/or converting nobles to the
      church of Agrik. Any noble PC will be approached and asked
      for a donation confirming his faith.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Marek of Kail is the acknowledged bastard child of a wealthy
        urban noble and his pretty young cook. It is uncertain if
        Marek was sired by the lord himself, or his then teenaged
        son, as they were both having relations with the cook at the
        time. The nobleman told his wife that he was acknowledging
        the child as his grandson, as he believed his wife did not
        know about his affair with the cook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of his actual parentage, Marek grew up in a
        privileged fashion. Trained to be a soldier, he might have
        even been a candidate for knighthood if not for his allergy
        to horses. Being too close to them for too long makes him
        sneeze and develop a runny nose. Although he can ride, he
        almost never does.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to their urban land holdings, Marek's family are
        silent partners in a large number of mercantile operations,
        including many caravans. At his father's urging, Marek works
        as a guard on caravans funded by his family. He ensures
        their investments are well protected and properly accounted
        for. To disguise the ties between he and his father to
        outsiders, Marek uses his mother's clan name. The caravan
        organizers are well aware of who he is and that he is acting
        as his father's observer and agent. Marek has participated
        in three caravans so far. His father has already noticed an
        increase in profits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marek is earning a reputation as a tough, but fairminded man
        with some good connections. Some of the regular freelance
        guards have begun to defer to his lead and orders during the
        caravan journeys. Marek has spoken to his father about
        forming his own company of caravan guards, with his family
        as the financial backing. His father is considering this,
        but for political reasons would like his involvement to
        remain behind the scenes.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Investigators.">
      Marek suspects that one of the
      caravan masters is smuggling. He hires the PCs to
      investigate some of the deliveries while he keeps an eye on
      the mercantyler himself.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Recruits.">
      The caravan was attacked, and many guards
      were killed. The caravan master believes that enough guards
      remain for the rest of the journey. Marek disagrees. He
      seeks to hire the PCs as guards. He promises his father will
      pay them at their next destination.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Politics.">
      Marek's father is not without political
      enemies. They fear his growing financial power and decide to
      send him a message. The PCs are hired through intermediaries
      to kill Marek and deliver his head to his father. The other
      caravan guards will help protect him. If they succeed, it
      will earn them an implacable enemy for life.

      <p>
        Born in the thran hold of Stafen near Beleka, it was obvious
        even from a young age that one day Grimhilda would serve as
        a shield-maiden to clan Forsetha. Her tremendous size (even
        as a child), strength and aptitude for war craft made it a
        forgone conclusion. Her father Lars, and his third wife
        Soinikka Colaar, encouraged her, despite the unforgiving
        nature of a warrior's path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her father, Lars, a pilot by trade, took Grimhilda with
        him on a pilgrimage to Kyriheim when she was
        fourteen. Already 5'10&quot; tall, the priests singled her
        out as one marked by Sarajin. She remained on Kyriheim for
        seven years, becoming a priestess of Sarajin. Leaving
        Kyriheim, Grimhilda travelled to Mount Ilbengaad for the
        great festival. Climbing high on the mountain, she was
        caught in a fierce snowstorm. As the cold slowly stole the
        warmth from her body, she entered a state of great
        peace. In that moment she had a vision of the Elkyri
        Gresalyne telling her to &quot;seek her fate on the Misty
        Isle&quot;. When Grimhilda awoke the next morning, she was
        wrapped in a cloak of polar bear fur. The mysterious gift
        took the cold from her bones and gives her Usnarl's
        strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 717, Grimhilda returned home to visit her family. Within
        days, a ship bearing a message from Kjal Forsetha
        arrived. He requested that chests he had left with Lars be
        brought to his new barony on Hârn. He also stated that any
        Forsetha who wished to join him would be welcome. Grimhilda
        saw this as a sign and told her family that she would
        deliver the chests. Her half sister and best friend,
        Ygwelve, chose to go to Hârn with her. While looking for
        passage west in Beleka, an Agrikan priestess tried to
        recruit Grimhilda into the Crimson Dancers. When Grimhilda
        rebuffed her rudely, the Agrikan pulled a sword, a fatal
        mistake. This encounter has left Grimhilda with a strong
        distaste for the Crimson Dancers, and the churches of Agrik
        in general. In 718, Grimhilda, her wolfhounds Torga and
        Kang, her half sister Ygwelve, and the chests, arrived at
        Geda. Kjal Forsetha offered her a position as one of his
        huscarls, which she accepted.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Dog-napper:">
      Torga has gone missing. Any harm to the
      dog is likely to make Grimhilda very angry. PCs are asked to
      aid in the search for Torga, or perhaps they are the ones
      who took her.

    <note type="hook" value="The Celebration:">
      PCs encounter Grimhilda as she
      celebrates an Ivinian holiday at the local temple of
      Sarajin. An arm wrestling contest ensues. Drunken Ivinians
      may think she is an Elkyri (wife and helpmate of
      Sarajin).

      <p>
        The child of Lars Forsetha and his second wife Brunhild
        Pelenby, Ygwelve grew up in a large and prosperous family in
        the thran hold of Stafen near Beleka. Her father, a
        respected pilot and member of the thrangaad, was able to
        afford a good education for his children. Ygwelve has a
        natural talent for languages and writing, and was trained as
        a scribe and translator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up, Ygwelve's best friend was her older sister,
        Grimhilda; the two of them were constantly together and
        always getting into mischief. When Grimhilda announced she
        was leaving for Kyriheim, Ygwelve was distraught, knowing
        her sister would not be back for a long time. She tried to
        stow away on the ship, but her mother caught her. The
        sisters exchanged letters during the years away, which
        sparked a growing urge in Ygwelve to travel and see the
        world rather than do the work she was trained for. She also
        developed a knack for seeing things far away and knowing
        what was going to happen. When the opportunity came to leave
        Stafen and travel with her older sister, Ygwelve took it
        without hesitation. Her parents are unhappy with her choice,
        but did not try to stop her. They know Grimhilda will
        protect her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since coming to Geda, Ygwelve has earned Kjal Forsetha's
        appreciation and respect for her abilities as a scribe, and
        administrator. Rather than stay at the keep, she has taken
        up residence near the tollway, to help ensure the Baron's
        men collected the appropriate fees from travellers on the
        road.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost since the day of her arrival, the Hodiri warrior,
        Brynn, has courted her. She has visions of him and knows
        that someday he will be her husband, but she is not ready to
        settle down and so has chosen to ignore his advances... for
        now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 719 Ygwelve accompanied her sister on her travels through
        Melderyn, and enjoyed the trip immensely. Despite the
        potential dangers of travelling North to Kaldor, she is
        looking forward to the opportunity.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Vision:">
      Ygwelve has a vision that a group of
      people (the PCs) will be able to assist her group with a
      task. When she sees the PCs, she approaches them.

    <note type="hook" value="Translator:">
      The PCs need documents translated and
      hear of a travelling scribe who might be able to help
      them. Ygwelve is noticeably distraught when she reads the

      <p>
        Born to a wealthy family in Karejia, Shansea is used to a
        life of privilege. Her family's connections earned her an
        apprenticeship at the Helas Chantry. She excelled at her
        studies, completing her apprenticeship in six years. Despite
        her desire for a life of research, her family arranged a
        marriage to the only son of a neighbouring
        landowner. Tragically, her husband died less than a year
        after the marriage, leaving her a prosperous estate and an
        infant daughter. With her income assured, she settled in for
        a life of research, returning to her chantry
        periodically. Within a few years she had earned the rank of
        Sheneva.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shansea then began studying the workings of the human brain,
        something she found particularly intriguing. Her experiments
        used the estate staff and residents as unknowing, and
        unwilling, subjects. There were a number of unfortunate
        incidents that attracted the unwelcome and dangerous
        attention of the White Hand. In 708 she was declared
        renegade and forced to flee for her life. To cover her
        escape she set fire to the manor house, killing several
        servants and leaving sufficient evidence to make the White
        Hand believe she and her daughter had perished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shansea and her daughter fled north, eventually reaching
        Harling in Ibanvaal. There, she encountered the Order of the
        Crimson Dancer. Shansea found she had much in common with
        the Agrikans and came to a mutually beneficial
        arrangement. The Crimson Dancers arranged transportation to
        Orbaal and, in 715 rebuilt an old hunting lodge in the
        mountains for her research. They provide her with a generous
        stipend and a steady supply of research subjects. In return,
        Shansea has happily broadened her research to include the
        study of conditioning and behaviour modification requested
        by the Agrikans.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Gaeffel's father is Master Beltar Thola, bonded
        weaponcrafter to Caer Geda. The youngest and smallest of
        four children, Gaeffel was nicknamed &quot;The Runt&quot;
        by his older brothers. Though he proved to have a good eye
        for quality, it was obvious to his father that he was not
        suited to the family profession. Instead, his father
        arranged for Gaeffel to be educated and apprenticed to a
        Master Mercantyler from Thay. Gaeffel spent six years
        working on regular trade routes from Orbaal, Thay,
        Chyrefal, Cherafir, and occasionally as far east as
        Chelemby. It was during this time that he discovered the
        appeal of Haleanism and his addiction to gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, he had little money to gamble with, but that
        started to change as he rose within his profession and was
        able to earn money on his own. Usually, he won as much as he
        lost but during a trip to Thay he suffered a disastrous
        loss, which took every coin he had, plus more as well,
        creating a sizeable debt to the Lia Kavair. His master was
        furious and cast him out of the house. Gaeffel was penniless
        and on the streets, but not for long. The Lia Kavair offered
        to forgive his gambling debts if he would carry a package to
        Harden for them. Gaeffel accepted without question and
        without ever looking inside the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        After delivering the package, he returned to his home in
        Geda. Downplaying the nature of his parting from Thay,
        Gaeffel was able to secure employment as a bonded
        mercantyler to Baron Forsetha. His initial responsibilities
        included an audit of all the King's mines in the Anadel
        Highlands. Since his return to Geda, Gaeffel has tried to
        stay away from gambling, but it has been difficult. One of
        his strategies has been to limit himself to making bets
        outside the gambling dens. On one occasion, he wrestled with
        a trained (and de-clawed) bear brought to town by a
        circus. He lost the match, but won a large sum by betting
        heavily against himself through intermediaries.
      </p>

      One or more PCs are gambling, Gaeffel is

      <p>
        Rybryn's father was a petty nobleman who supported her and
        her mother from his position as a minor member of the royal
        government. He died when she was fourteen, leaving them with
        almost nothing except the house they lived in. To make ends
        meet, her mother first let the servants go and then began to
        sell off the family belongings. In desperation, Rybryn
        committed her first theft at age sixteen, taking jewels from
        another noblewoman's home.
      </p>
      <p>
        For two years crime provided a decent income for her and her
        mother. She always had some tale for where the coin was
        coming from, which her mother rarely believed. Afraid her
        daughter was prostituting herself, but in desperate need of
        the money, her mother did not press the issue. During one
        burglary, she was almost caught by the Lia Kavair and had to
        take an extended break. After that, she purchased a good
        quality short sword and paid a mercenary to teach her how to
        use it. She has never had to use the weapon, but carries it
        with her on the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        A year ago, Shadow entered the home of a nobleman, only to
        discover it was a trap. Rather than turn her over to the
        authorities, the mysterious owner revealed he knew her real
        identity and made her an offer she could not refuse. She
        would become his personal thief. In return he would protect
        her identity and pay her a monthly wage. She accepted. He
        also arranged for additional training that has made her more
        useful to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, a purse is delivered to Rybryn at the first of
        each month. Sometimes it contains only money; sometimes a
        small black stone is added to the contents. When the stone
        appears, Shadow goes to a prearranged location and receives
        instructions. Her missions have ranged from following
        someone to theft of documents, spying on meetings, and
        delivery of packages. She has tried to find out the identity
        of her mysterious master, but without success.

      <p>
        Most heralds are concerned with matters of state, diplomacy,
        heraldry and genealogy. Lord Wisby is more concerned with
        information, specifically, matters of concern to the
        kingdom. The Wisby family has served the Royal family as
        heralds and spies for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing his training at the college of heralds,
        Emmon Wisby began his real training, travelling throughout
        the kingdom and Hârn as a whole. During these travels he
        made and renewed contacts with informants and spies across
        all levels of society. Many commoner clans owe their
        prosperity to secret &quot;gifts&quot; from the Wisby's.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been over twenty years since Lord Emmon's father
        passed away, leaving him in charge of the network. In that
        time, he has worked to broaden and strengthen the sources of
        information, and to speed the lines of communication. His
        sources have uncovered many secrets throughout the years;
        many of these have given his King an added edge in the daily
        politics of rule. Some secrets, Lord Emmon has kept to
        himself, feeling that the good of the kingdom was best
        served by these bits of information staying
        secret. Regrettably, sometimes his agents discover something
        too dangerous for them to stay on Hârn, so Lord Emmon has
        them sent to Yashain, and not by way of Barasi
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only the King himself and a few others are aware of Lord
        Emmon's true duties to the crown. He uses a number of
        intermediaries and agents within all levels of society. With
        no children of his own, Lord Emmon has begun searching for
        his replacement. While certainly outside the norm, he
        believes he has found a woman that would make a worthy
        heir.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Unknowing Agents:">
      The spy network needs a group

      without being caught they will be well paid, and given other
      tasks.

    <note type="hook" value="Clan Loyalties:">
      One of the PCs has been told by his

      with the rest of the PCs.

      The PCs were asked to uncover
      certain information, which they did and dutifully
      reported. Shortly thereafter, they were declared outlaw, and
      had to run for their lives. Now, they are being tracked by
      assassins (or worse).

      <p>
        Wyrin's family has lived in Geda for as long as anyone can
        remember, serving a succession of noble landholders as
        huntsmen and yeomen for generations. During the Kaldoric
        occupation after the Treasure War, the Varross clan led a
        resistance movement and fed information back to the King
        living in exile in Thay. They are highly respected archers
        and foot soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wyrin's skill with a longbow stands out even amongst his
        family; he has already won the annual Burzyn tournament
        twice. In 717, after his second victory, Baron Forsetha
        approached him. Impressed with his archery skills and
        knowledge of the local region, he offered Wyrin a position
        as guide to his huscarls, which is especially necessary when
        they patrol north of the Ulmerien River. Wyrin eagerly
        accepted the position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike most of his family, he is fascinated with the Ivinian
        culture and influences that the Baron has brought to
        Geda. He has spent many hours at the Sarajin temple talking
        to the priests and attending the services. Despite his
        mother's warning that no good can come of it, Wyrin has
        recently converted to the worship of Sarajin. He has not
        quite reconciled the code of honour involving personal
        combat with his use of the longbow, but figures Sarajin will
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wyrin has developed a strong friendship with Grimhilda. She
        has told him many of the stories of Sarajin and he has
        taught her the folklore of Chybisa and helped improved her
        Harnic. For his help, Grimhilda gave him an Ivinian
        broadsword she had brought from her homeland. In addition,
        the Baron has provided him with a mail byrnie, making him
        one of the best-equipped yeomen in his service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since accepting the position with the Baron, Wyrin has
        travelled widely and enjoyed many adventures with good
        companions. He hopes to turn this into a permanent
        position. His mother wants him to settle down, get married
        and have some more Varross children.
      </p>

      One or more PCs are in an archery
      contest. Wyrin is one of the other contestants. He shoots so
      well, people begin to wonder if he is a Sindarin; surely he
      is too ugly, unless he is in disguise.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Unpleasant Encounter:">
      A noble or Ivinian PC may take
      exception of Wyrin, a non-Ivinian commoner, carrying an
      Ivinian broadsword. They may or may not recognize his
      Forsetha badge. Things may get ugly until his patron
      arrives.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Sir Morhgan came to Golotha as an impoverished knight
        bachelor hoping to join one of the Agrikan fighting
        orders. Instead, he was employed as a bodyguard to a
        Morgathian priest. At first, it was just a job; the temple
        fed him, clothed him, gave him armor and weapons, but as
        the years went by, he slowly converted to the worship of
        Morgath. He found the act of human sacrifice to be very
        satisfying to some black corner of his soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the eve of his thirteenth year of service to the temple,
        he was invited to a special ceremony. It was only when the
        priests seized him that he realize that he was to be the
        sacrifice. With a Bukrai blade piercing his belly and his
        life draining away, the priests offered him Myrvria's Kiss,
        Morhgan accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first he was angry, but the lure of the shadow, and the
        power of being undead soon overcame his remaining
        humanity. On the first of his thirteen &quot;lives&quot;,
        Sir Morhgan still passes as human, though there are clues
        to his true nature. His voice is raspy and dry, his breath
        smells of his rotting innards, and his fingernails are
        yellowed and cracked from building his resting place deep
        within the old Morgathian temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after his transformation, the Khidarmur (High Priest)
        sent him on a mission. In 719, the temple had secretly sent
        an artefact to the East. It was meant for a hidden temple,
        but the caravan transporting it disappeared somewhere on the
        Salt Route. Sir Morhgan is to recover the artefact and take
        it to the temple himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Cade was given a warhorse to use on his quest; the horse
        has succumbed to the Shadow of Bukrai and become a
        gulmorvrus in his service. Sir Cade does not need to sleep,
        eat, or breath. He does normally try to avoid travelling
        under full sunlight conditions. In combat, Sir Cade does not
        tire, and can be very patient waiting for his opponent to
        tire before coming in for the kill.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Sir Chadrin lives for three things: fighting, drinking, and
        wenching. The third son of the bailiff of Milnyrd manor
        (Chybisa), Charles was knighted on his twenty-first birthday
        in 717. He left home with a priceless suit of armor, an
        aging warhorse, a dented shield, a poor quality sword and
        instructions not to come back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chadrin's great grandfather travelled widely before coming
        to Chybisa. During his travels he acquired a suit of
        Khuzan armor; how, he never revealed. He settled in
        Milnyrd and never aspired to be anything greater than the
        bailiff of a small manor. When it became apparent that
        neither of his sons would be able to wear his armor, he
        put an inscription inside the helmet; &quot;Whomsoever of
        my descendants can wear this armor properly, mount their
        horse unaided, and still fight, may have it as their
        birthright&quot;. Many tried to fulfil those terms, but
        only Chadrin succeeded. The matching sword and shield that
        once accompanied the armor were lost during the Treasure
        War.
      </p>
      <p>
        To say that Chadrin is unpopular oversimplifies a long
        series of problems, the most important of which is a
        longstanding, bitter rivalry with Rithalyr Legith, the son
        of his family's liege lord. Neither of them truly remembers
        the incident that started their rivalry, but have nothing
        but contempt for the other. Sir Chadrin believes that
        Rithalyr blocked his bid to join the Chybisan Royal
        Guard. Rejected by the Royal Guard, Sir Chadrin went to the
        one person in the country that might take him in, Baron Kjal
        Forsetha. Kjal knew of his fighting abilities (having seen
        him fight in the squire's tournament the year before), and
        despite, or perhaps because of, the political ramifications,
        offered him a position in his company of huscarls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chadrin has found working for the Baron and the Ivinian
        nature of his court much to his liking. Despite this, he
        remains devoted to Larani, often debating the nature of the
        gods over beer with his Sarajin worshipping compatriots. In
        719, Sir Chadrin used his considerable tournament winnings
        to register his personal, and somewhat unorthodox, heraldry
        of Three Mugs over Crossed Swords.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Khuzan Shield:">
      One of the PCs has a Khuzan made
      shield. Sir Chadrin recognizes it as the one meant to go
      with his armor. He will offer to purchase it first, then a
      challenge if denied.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Drunken Knight:">
      Sir Chadrin is making his way home after one of his
      &quot;rare&quot; nights of drinking to excess. He encounters
      the PCs while deep in his cups. He is still a dangerous
      combatant.

      <p>
        When Lyesa was eleven years old, her life changed
        drastically. She had never wanted for anything, with good
        tutors and a loving if somewhat distant mother. Then, one
        night, without warning her mother took her and fled as her
        childhood home burned to the ground behind them. She knows
        that her mother is a Shenava of the Shek P'var and that she
        somehow she angered the Guild, but does not understand
        why. She loves her mother and does not see a problem with
        experimenting on peasants or even killing them for that
        matter. The experience left her with an abiding hatred for
        other Shek P'var.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Crimson Dancers found Lyesa and her mother in
        Harling, a whole new world of opportunities opened up for
        her. As part of the arrangements, Lyesa was squired to a
        Crimson Dancer knight at Quimen; she became a skilled
        warrior and was knighted in 717. Her mother has trained
        her in the psionic skills she inherited; when combined
        with Lyesa's martial skills they make her the ideal person
        to find new candidates for the experiments her mother is
        conducting at her lodge near Quimen. Lyesa was out on a
        &quot;recruiting&quot; mission when one of their more
        promising candidates (Kibâ) escaped with the aid of Jarin
        rebels. She is in charge of the search to return the
        wayward recruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through a combination of agents, paid informants,
        mercenaries, and other contacts, she has been able to slowly
        narrow the search and knows it will only be a matter of time
        before her quarry is brought to ground. May or may not be
        wearing the heraldry of the Crimson Dancer.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Muscle:">
      Lyesa believes that a nobleman has
      information on her quarry. She hires the PCs to provide

      <p>
        A Bujoc Sha woman raised Kit'tiara, but she never felt like
        she really belonged among the Bujoc. Her totem was a strange
        symbol carved into stone rather than the normal wooden
        animal icon. When she was 16, her mother revealed to her
        that she had not been born among the Bujoc. She was found
        with a dying woman in the Northern Anadels near Telumar. The
        woman had an advanced case of infection from a gargun arrow
        imbedded in her leg. She died holding Kit'tiara in one arm
        and clutching the amulet Kit'tiara now wears in the other
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Bujoc beliefs that foreswear metal weapons, her
        adoptive mother stored the dead woman's effects in a small
        dry cave. After revealing to Kit'tiara that she had not been
        born Bujoc, she showed her adopted daughter the dagger,
        broken short sword and mail byrnie owned by her real
        mother. Kit'tiara left the effects in the cave.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the fall of 718, Kit'tiara encountered a group of
        foreigners camping in the Anadels. One of them, an unusually
        tall woman, had many items engraved with symbols similar to
        the one on her amulet. Intrigued by this, Kit'tiara followed
        them. Three days later, she discovered a group of Chindra
        gargun preparing to attack the strangers. Kit'tiara decided
        to warn them. Rather than flee as the Bujoc normally do, the
        foreigners decided to investigate and attacked the
        gargun. Watching the fight, Kit'tiara became convinced that
        she did not belong with the Bujoc. She also came to
        understand the nature of metal -- it provided you a means to
        fight evil. With metal, you did not have to run and
        hide.
      </p>
      <p>
        After she left the foreigners, Kit'tiara retrieved her
        mother's effects. When she returned, she formally introduced
        herself and asked the tall woman what the symbol on her
        amulet meant. Since then, the group has made her welcome,
        gifted her with a new sword, helped her restore her mother's
        armor and dagger to pristine condition, and shown her that
        the world is a much larger, far more complicated place than
        the Anadel Highlands.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Arwalin was born on the Isle of Melderyn, the fourth child
        and only son of a yeoman household. When he was just a
        child, his father was killed in a hunting accident by the
        local baron. To make amends, the baron provided for the
        family and took Arwalin into his service as a huntsman when
        he was old enough. After a decade of duty, Arwalin developed
        a serious case of wanderlust. He sought and was granted
        permission to take leave of his duties and travel. Since
        that time he has travelled throughout Hârn.
      </p>
      <p>
        While in Kaldor, he spent time at the Peonian church in
        Bromeleon. The priests took a liking to him and he spent
        several months there working as a lay brother. Later, he
        escorted an iterant priest, Father Braeld, for nearly a
        year, crisscrossing Kaldor. When his work was finished,
        Arwalin then took his leave again and headed east.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skilled in the wilderness, Arwalin has little trouble
        feeding himself in the wilderness. If he runs afoul of the
        law, he bears a scroll naming him as the baron's
        liegeman. He drifts from region to region, finding work as
        his money runs out and taking odd jobs. He has worked as a
        mercenary, though he has little taste for killing
        humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        At thirty-three years old, Arwalin wants to settle down,
        however a serious kick to the groin when he was a teenager
        has rendered him sterile, making it more difficult to find a
        wife since he knows he can't have children. He has no
        pressing urge to return home, as he knows his mother and
        sisters are well taken care of. If something better does not
        appear in the near future, he is considering entering the
        Peonian church as a lay brother.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Guide in the Wilderness:">
      The PCs lack tracking and
      wilderness skills and are trying to find some lost
      ruins. Arwalin is between jobs and is recommended to
      them.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Warning of a Gargun Attack:">
      While living deep in the
      bush, Arwalin spotted a gargun swarm moving through the
      wilderness directly towards the PCs location, he bursts into
      their camp with warning and asks their help in protecting a
      nearby village directly in its path.

    <note type="hook" value="We're Being Watched:">
      The PCs begin to get the eerie
      feeling they are being watched. Arwalin has been hired by

      has heard rumours of a wild man, possibly a brigand, living

      will try to avoid the PCs and leave quietly.

      <p>
        Chieftain Brun is the greatest chieftain of the Kuza Clan in
        a dozen generations. His skill in the forest is legendary
        among the three clans. None can find him unless he wants to
        be found. He has an uncanny ability to know what his
        opponent is going to do and thus is almost always able to
        gain the element of surprise. Unlike most Drûghu who stay
        close to their extended family, Brun roams widely, checking
        back with his family seemingly at random, but almost always
        when his presence is needed. Two or three young woodsmen,
        eager to learn forest craft from so great a master,
        sometimes accompany him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although young in years, Brun has developed a deep
        friendship with Noron. Like all Drûghu, Brun suffers from
        xenophobia, but his is mild and he manages it well,
        allowing him to interact with Noron and his sons (and
        perhaps those who the demi-god will vouch for). Brun
        sometimes acts as scout and tracker when Noron is hunting
        gargun. The two share a burning mutual hatred of
        gargun. Brun's mother was killed by a gargun attack on the
        family encampment, adding fuel to the almost inborn Drûghu
        hatred of the foulspawn. Brun is well known and feared by
        the gargun of the colonies of Sokus, Zadabir and
        Zhakom. Recognized by his distinctive tattoos, they refer
        to him as &quot;The Bludgeoner&quot;. His trademark is
        smashing in a gargun's skull with his massive stone-headed
        club.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brun is apolitical, with no particular aspirations to lead
        the Drûghu people, though they would undoubtedly follow him
        if he asked. He seems content to live in the moment, roaming
        the forest and protecting his people from the depredations
        of the gargun, the protector of Clan Kuza.
      </p>
      <p>
        A powerful psionic, Brun limits the use of his powers since
        he often suffers severe headaches for hours after their
        use. He knows the location of every Barasi Point in Drûghu
        territory and several outside it, including two near Noron's
        Keep. His prescience ability, combined with hard won
        experience, allow him to predict what the gargun will do in
        any given situation. He aids Noron in return for an unspoken
        promise of the demi-god's help in event of a serious gargun
        swarm or incursion.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Deus Ex Machina:">
      Due to Brun's extremely powerful
      skills and attributes, GM's are strongly advised to use him
      with caution. He is perhaps best used as an ally of Noron,
      lurking in the woods, barely more than a shadow.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Eerie Feeling:">
      To visit Anrist Point, the PCs must
      travel through Drûghu territory. As soon as they enter, they
      sense someone is watching them. Brun and his men will only
      watch unless something draws them out.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Ealfric was born into war. His parents were minor nobility,
        cousins of Ranald Milaka. His father held a single manor in
        the Kingdom of Gemala, in what is now southern Kanday. His
        mother was four months pregnant when King Puril
        invaded. Ealfric's father was killed and his mother fled
        into hiding, taking refuge with a sympathetic yeoman. She
        died giving birth to him. Ealfric was adopted into the
        yeoman's clan and raised as their son. When he turned 18,
        they told him of the circumstances of his birth. He chose to
        leave the only family he had ever know and seek his fortune
        in the world, something which has made him very unpopular
        with his adopted siblings.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a master archer, a skill he learned from his adopted
        father. He is also a bowyer and fletcher of considerable
        ability. For several years, Ealfric earned a comfortable
        living teaching archery, winning competitions and making
        bows. This bored him and so he sought work in the
        north. There, he participated in several seasons of
        skirmishing with the Copper Hook in the service of the Earl
        of Selvos. He earned a formidable reputation as an archer
        and skirmisher. The Rethemi even offered a sizable bounty
        for him by name. Eventually he left the Earl's service and
        drifted east, taking work as a mercenary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ealfric is a passive soul, accepting things as they
        happen. He has a great sense of humour and a taste for bad
        puns. A mysterious aura surrounds him and he doesn't talk
        much about his past. Lately he has taken up the unusual
        practice of climbing trees and mountains. Ealfric claims he
        finds great peace in the trees or quiet mountainsides. He
        has also found gargun on occasion and earned considerable
        bounties for their heads.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Bows and Arrows.">
      Longbows are not a common weapon,
      but are popular with PCs. Ealfric has set up shop and is
      selling longbows for an outrageous price. They are the best
      in many leagues. Ealfric offers to trade them two new bows
      if they do a small errand for him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Recruiting.">
      Ealfric has decided to go into business
      as a mercenary captain. He is looking for other bowmen to
      join his company. He already has a contract to escort a
      caravan in the same direction the PCs are going anyway.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Patents of Nobility.">
      Ealfric's adopted father gave
      him a document when he left home. It is a baptismal record
      from an itinerant Laranian priest who was present during his
      birth. If he can find this man, he can testify as to who
      Ealfric's true mother was. Then Ealfric can petition the
      royal court in Dyrisa to have his rightful status
      restored. He will be very grateful to those who help
      him.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Born in Paran, shortly after the Thardic League annexed
        it, Klinla is the bastard son of a senior official and a
        jeweller's daughter. Even though he was the eldest
        grandchild of the jeweller, his bastard status made him
        unpopular even as a child. He was brought up in the family
        business, but always had to work twice as hard for half
        the recognition. He completed his apprenticeship and left
        Paran to become a journeyman. His departure was not
        mourned and his grandfather made his status clear &quot;I
        have clothed you, fed you and given you a trade for the
        sake of my daughter. You are eighteen; I owe you nothing
        more. Never return, I declare our relationship
        concluded.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Klinla has travelled extensively throughout Hârn and Lythia,
        including spending almost twenty years living in Azeryan. He
        earned the title master jeweller and has made a considerable
        fortune trading gold, silver and gems. His exquisitely
        crafted jewellery is in great demand among the wealthy and
        elite of Hârn. Perhaps because of the rejection by his
        family, a somewhat homely appearance and squinty eyes,
        Klinla compensates by being an exceptionally friendly
        man. He has a knack for being warm and comforting, quickly
        putting new acquaintances and customers at ease. He is well
        known as an honest and upstanding businessman. His word is
        his bond and he has many friends in high places as a
        result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Klinla travels continuously from city to city, with
        significant amounts of precious metals and gems. Because of
        this, he hires only the best and most reliable sellswords to
        provide security for his goods and act as his bodyguards. He
        pays top wages and rewards loyalty highly. His network of
        contacts includes wealthy guildsmen and nobility. He rarely
        stays in inns, as he has dozens of standing invitations to
        stay with his many satisfied customers.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Replacement Bodyguards.">
      Klinla needs to replace or
      augment some of his bodyguards. If the PCs have a reputation
      for honesty and a letter of recommendation from someone he
      trusts, Klinla might consider hiring them. He will also have
      at least two additional sellswords of long employ and proven
      loyalty.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Rich Prize.">
      Rumour has it that Klinla is travelling
      with a particularly large amount of jewellery destined for
      an Earl in Kaldor. Barbarians killed some of his guards and
      his wagons are less guarded than usual. Klinla himself would
      fetch a handsome ransom.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="More Portable Wealth.">
      The PCs have recently come into
      a large amount of money. It has proved awkward to transport
      and they are looking to convert it into jewellery. Klinla
      comes recommended as an honest dealer.

      <p>
        Orlir is from Ibonost. He grew up there, doing his locksmith
        apprenticeship with his father. When he was old enough, he
        enrolled in the town militia. At first it was very
        exciting. When he was 17, there was a rumour of Thardic
        raiders to the north and the constable called for volunteers
        to chase them down. Against his father's advice, Orlir
        volunteered. The raiders turned out to be members of an
        Agrikan fighting order. The constable led the men right into
        an ambush. Because he was on horseback, the knight was able
        to escape, leaving the militia to be captured and taken back
        to Coranan as slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sold for just 150d, he was bought by a sadistic brute. For
        the next year, the teen was regularly sodomized and forced
        to perform unnatural acts by his master. Any resistance
        resulted in a severe beating. The beatings broke his will
        within the first three months and his sole focus became
        survival. After about a year, one of his fellow slaves
        murdered their master and seven of them managed to slip over
        the wall and out of the city. The Agrikans hunted them
        mercilessly. To his shame, Orlir abandoned the other slaves
        to make good his own escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orlir eventually made his way back to Ibonost and his
        family, but he has never been the same since. He has
        recovered some of his willpower, but he is still easily
        intimidated. He bears a slaver's brand on his right buttock
        and is suspicious of everyone. He has an almost pathological
        hatred towards the nobility, which he nurses secretly. He is
        as disrespectful and sullen as he dares.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeated rapes by his master have scarred him sexually. He
        can no longer be intimate with a woman and this makes him
        angry. He takes it out on those weaker than himself,
        especially women, slapping them around. He has been married
        three times, unsuccessfully. He has taken to travelling to
        escape his past and to try to find peace.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Revenge.">
      Orlir hates the Kandian nobility, Agrikans
      and slavers equally. This is well known. Properly presented,
      a clever PC could use this to gain his locksmith assistance
      to hurt them. Despite his combat skills, Orlir is likely to
      break and run in event of a fight.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Traitor.">
      One of the other escapees survived, no
      thanks to Orlir. Now he wants revenge against the locksmith
      who left him to suffer three more years of slavery.

    <note type="hook" value="Damn Noble.">
      The group's most arrogant noble PC is walking through town
      when a disrespectful guildsman bumps into him. Although he
      makes a half-hearted apology, he is heard muttering under
      his breath &quot;bloody noble ass&quot; as he walks
      away. Will the PC let it go?

        Petry has always known he would be a litigant. The son,
        grandson and great-grandson of litigants, the law is in his
        blood. He was born in Burzyn, Chybisa, but as the second
        son, the franchise was already promised to his older
        brother, so at age twelve, he was fostered to a family
        friend in Cherafir. When he completed his apprenticeship, he
        travelled to Trierzon where he completed his training and
        became a master litigant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Petry has developed a belief, some would say
        obsession, in superstitions, especially astronomy and
        tarotry. He will not take a case until he has consulted the
        star signs and tarot cards. Strangely enough, it has brought
        him great success. He has earned a very good living as a
        litigant, enough to buy a large stone building in Thay, near
        Moque Gate, with living space, a workshop and warehouse. He
        rents this out to a mercantyler and lives very comfortably
        off the income.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is five foot, eight inches tall will very pink skin,
        taupe hair and blue eyes. The heavy clothes he wears hide
        how skinny he is; he weighs only 138 lbs. He is a very
        intense man and becomes easily bored with routine. Intensely
        secretive, he hides his money with many different usurers
        and often conceals who he really is. A control freak, he
        must always control what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although only thirty-two, his investments and property mean
        he does not have to work unless he wants to. He has taken to
        travelling of late and has visited most major towns and
        castles of Melderyn, Chybisa and Kaldor. His inquisitive
        nature is drawing him even further in search of something to
        challenge or excite him.

      <p>
        Born in England during the reign of Henry II, Sir Rollard
        was trained as a knight and has proven to be a skilled
        jouster and outstanding swordsman. When King Richard I
        called for knights to join him on his crusade to liberate
        the Holy Land from the infidels, he was among the first. In
        1190, Sir Rollard with his charger Blaze set sail from
        Portsmouth for the Holy Land. Due to the time of year, the
        voyage was rough. Late one evening a storm of great ferocity
        hit them, tossing the ship like a cork. When the storm
        ended, the captain had no idea where they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the eighteenth day, with water running low, they sighted
        land. When they landed to take on water they encountered
        several farmers. The crew had never heard the language they
        spoke. The captain insisted on setting sail again
        immediately. Seasick and with no confidence the captain knew
        where he was going, Sir Rollard refused. He had Blaze
        brought ashore along with his armor, weapons and
        baggage. The ship departed, never to be seen
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using sign language and gestures, he was able to buy two
        mules for his baggage and get directions to the nearest
        castle. Upon arriving, he sought out the local lord. Mounted
        on a fine charger, bearing arms and with noble bearing,
        there was no doubt he was a knight, but the lord couldn't
        understand a word he said. He sent for a Save K'norrian
        priest. Using the invocation Tongues, he was able to
        interpret for the strange knight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Rollard learned he was in the Kingdom of Kanday and no
        one had ever heard of England or Normandy. Over the next
        month, Baron Tobrin Jevasa of Gimon hosted the foreign
        knight, helping him learn something of the Hârnic
        language. At the Baron's suggestion, he decided to enter a
        local tournament, winning easily. Having earned enough to
        support himself for several weeks, he thanked his host and
        set out to explore the island. The lone Norman knight has
        spent the last eight years travelling from tournament to
        tournament. He makes a good living, but is tired of the
        travel. He either wants to go home (how he has no idea) or
        to settle down in the service of a great lord.

      The PCs recently recovered a document
      with strange writing on it. A foreign knight has words
      written on his shield in the same script (Latin). Sir
      Rollard is very interested in the document. In eight years,
      this is the first clue that may lead him back to
      England.

      <p>
        Afflicted with dwarfism, Swey's life was decided for him the
        moment he was born. No one ever bothered to consider whether
        he was intelligent or not, he was a mongrel, the runt of the
        litter, useful as nothing more than an amusement. The child
        of slaves, even his own parents could not protect him. He
        was dragged to the thranaal and made to dance and cavort for
        his Ivinian master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sewy's situation was made all the more painful because his
        dwarfism has not affected his mind. He is intelligent and
        can see and hear everything around him very clearly. At a
        young age, he always had a sixth sense when something bad
        was going to happen. Only his iron kept him alive through
        the hell that was his childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opportunity came in the strangest guise. A passing merchant
        took a fondness to the strange little boy and bought him to
        amuse his wife. Swey travelled with the merchant's caravan
        for several years. Although he was still expected to perform
        for his mistress, during the day he was left alone. When
        they reached Melderyn, the merchant boarded a ship for
        home. There, on the docks, he freed Swey and told him he was
        a slave no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        While struggling to survive, Swey found work tending horses
        for a mercenary company. One day while the unit was
        escorting a merchant caravan, Swey got an overwhelming
        feeling of danger as they approached the forest. He warned
        the captain, who, perplexed by this little man's insistence,
        sent scouts ahead. They discovered brigands waiting in
        ambush. After that, Swey sort of became the unit's good luck
        charm. They even taught him to use a short
        bow. Unfortunately, prescience cannot prevent a lack of
        contracts and the company broke up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, Swey has been working for an ostler cleaning
        stables. He hates it but it puts food in the
        belly.

    <note type="hook" value="Fortune Teller:">

        Taran is the archetypal barbarian, with massive muscles and
        skill in the wilderness, but this façade conceals a
        brilliant mind. Born a bastard, he was acknowledged as the
        eldest son of the chief. Raised in his father's household,
        he was the favourite, rising rapidly through the ranks of
        the tribe's hunters thanks to his strength and
        speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taran left his tribe at seventeen and travelled to Orbaal
        where he took service with Clan Staeld at Fjaga Keep. There,
        he learning language and weapon skills and fell in love with
        a beautiful thrall named Yrina. One evening, during a feast,
        a visiting merchant from Leriel, Mikha Baery, lusted after
        Yrina and bought her from Lord Albyn for six
        broadswords. Determined to get her back, Taran followed,
        only to find their camp and Yrina dead in a ditch. Mikha had
        raped her and then give her to his men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outraged and disgusted, Taran headed home where he resumed
        the role of heir-apparent. Eight months later, he arrived in
        the camp to discover the Mikha dining with his father. Since
        the man was a guest, he said nothing. Mikha goaded Taran for
        days bragging how Yrina had squirmed. Finally, the young
        barbarian broke. He whipped out his broadsword and
        decapitating the man in a single stroke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guests are sacrosanct in Ymodi culture. His father declared
        the sentence and the men of the village seized him. His legs
        and arms were to be broken and he was to be left to die in
        the forest. Four men dragged him from the camp. Three men
        held him down while the fourth broke his leg with a
        club. Using all of his strength he broke free and threw
        himself into the river. Outlawed, he can never return to
        Ymodi lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        His leg healed twisted and weak, leaving his with a severe
        limp. Otherwise, he is in good health. He has a dark
        complexion, black hair and grey eyes. Taran looks older than
        his twenty-four years, but has a cheerful, irreverent and
        enthusiastic disposition. He constantly toys with the eagle
        totem he wears around his neck.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Mercenary:">
      Despite his limp, Taran is a fine warrior
      and could be found working in any kingdom except
      Orbaal.

        raised to a life of privilege and a full belly. The second
        son, the apprenticeship and inheritance went to his older
        brother. Vakon was expected to work for his father until his
        brother came home a master and then he was expected to work
        for him. He saw no future but cleaning pots and waiting
        tables. When his beloved mother died, there was no more
        reason to stay. He told his father he wanted to seek his own
        future in the world. Disappointed, but understanding, he
        gave him two dozen silver pennies and sent him on his
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vakon drifted from keep to castle, village to town,
        finding work where he could. Eventually, his luck and
        money ran out and he became desperate. Using a length of
        firewood, he knocked a drunken old fool over the head and
        stole his purse. Flush with his first success he robbed
        two more men. That brought him to the attention of the
        LiaKavair. A group of toughs dragged him out of a tavern
        and beat him senseless and took his ill-gotten gains in
        &quot;taxes&quot;. Fortunately, the leader took a shine to
        the plucky young lad and took him under his wing. He has
        been a member of the Lia-Kavair for several years now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five foot three inches, he is of medium build and weighs
        around 133 lbs. He has brown hair and brown eyes and a
        purple birthmark on his neck that runs up under his hair. He
        is a cocky fellow, but furtive, always looking around to see
        who is following or watching him. He always seems in a hurry
        and can be quite blunt and to the point when he talks.

      <p>
        Vandulf was forced to find work at an early age. The third
        of eleven children of a poor fisherman, he was forced to
        grow up fast. By age six, he was working with his father,
        cleaning fish, fixing nets. By twelve, Vanulf had had enough
        of fishing to last a lifetime and ran away. The son of a
        serf, the lord of the manor hunted him down and dragged him
        back. He will bear the scars from the whipping he received
        to his grave.
      </p>
      <p>
        His second flight was better planned. Nineteen, he had had
        time to save a few coins doing odd jobs and stash a bag with
        enough food for the trip. On the night of Harvest Home, he
        circulated to make sure everyone saw him. Once the party was
        in full swing, he slipped down to the water, recovered his
        bag and slipped his father's tiny dinghy into the river. He
        sailed all night and through the next day. By the time
        anyone noticed he was gone, he was already well on his way
        to Golotha. A year and a day later, he was a free
        man.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Golotha, he worked as a labourer, never working more than
        a few months for any one master. Although quiet, he is
        easily offended. If he feels slighted, he will just
        disappear and move on to a new job. His wanderlust has taken
        him all over eastern Harn. He is strong and rarely has
        trouble finding work.
      </p>
      <p>
        At six foot one inch tall, 174 lbs, with red hair and green
        eyes, he has great trouble blending in. He wears a wool cap
        to hide his hair and has developed a stoop to make himself
        look shorter. He hates being singled out. A simple man, he
        confuses information and facts easily, though he always
        seems to be able to find the best fishing hole in the
        area. Fish forms much of his diet. He doesn't wash much and
        has only a single set of filthy clothing.

      <p>
        Formerly of Leriel in Orbaal, Wyte is a travelling house
        builder. The seventh son of a poor, but free, farmer, he
        knew that his father could never afford to leave him any
        land. When he was 12, a thatcher visited his village. He was
        fascinated by how the man sculpted normal straw with his
        sickle and turned it into a watertight roof. After watching
        for a few hours, he asked if he could help. Two days later
        Wyte announced to his family that he had asked the thatcher
        if he could become his apprentice and the man had
        agreed. His mother cried, but everyone knew there were
        already too many mouths to feed. His father wished him well,
        slipping him his last 10d. It would be six years before he
        saw them again.
      </p>
      <p>
        He travelled with his master for sixteen years before
        starting his own business. Although officially felling
        trees, building stone foundations, erecting crucks and
        making nails are all guild activities, in the backwoods of
        Orbaal, many of these trades are rarely seen. Out of
        necessity, Wyte has become a very skilled
        jack-of-all-trades. He is always careful to contract with
        suitable guildsmen when they are present and to offer to pay
        fines to others to overlook his transgressions of guild
        privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        At eighteen, Wyte married his master's daughter, but she
        died of a fever seven years ago. He has three strapping
        teenage sons who are learning the family trade. The four
        travel widely, repairing roofs and building new houses. They
        rarely stay in one place for long. They visit his brothers
        and sisters on occasion, but are soon on the move
        again. Lately, Wyte has been musing about trying his
        fortunes in Kaldor or points further south.
      </p>
      <p>
        Father and sons are all skilled with homemade clubs and
        shields and well able to defend themselves. They make a good
        living, but Wyte is hoarding his money hoping to eventually
        settle down and buy a farm. He wants to find wives for his
        sons and retire, hopefully as a grandpa.

      The PCs are involved with the

      farm.

      <p>
        The son of a Morgathian priest, Silas Marchant grew up in
        Golotha and followed in his father's footsteps. He is also a
        member of the Physicians guild, with the rank of Journeyman,
        and as such he can be encountered almost anywhere on
        Hârn. Silas's true purpose is to find a suitable location
        for the establishment of a new covert Morgathian temple
        somewhere in Hârn.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a common practice for some young priests to be sent
        out for the purposes of proselytising and corruption of the
        masses. Those chosen see this as an honour and validation of
        their commitment to Morgath. The temple hierarchy see it
        more as scattering seeds across the land. Most will fail,
        but a few might take root and grow into something
        useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all actuality, Silas was somewhat of a disappointment
        to his family, so when the opportunity came, he was
        &quot;Honoured&quot; with this assignment. Silas is smart
        enough to understand the risks, but edging on insane
        enough that he is sure he will never be caught. His goal
        is to make a temple to rival any in Golotha. Unfortunately
        he is lazy and careless, unlikely to succeed or survive
        long.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only success he has had so far is locating a cache of
        books and artefacts left from the Theocracy of
        Tekhos. Rather than return to Golotha and reap the rewards
        of bringing such valuable goods to the temple, he has kept
        them for himself, even though the majority of the material
        is beyond his current abilities to use.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Incompetent Physician:">
      The PCs need a physician
      that does not ask any questions. Silas fits the bill, but
      his incompetence may make things worse.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Disappearing Patients:">
      Some of Silas's patients
      never leave his care. Sacrificed to Morgath, they provide
      bodies for his experiments. He is not very careful about
      disposing of the remains.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Gulmorvin attack:">
      Silas got lucky and perfected one
      of the unique rituals in the books he found. Unfortunately,
      things have gotten out of hand and the residents of the
      local graveyard have been turned to Gulmorvin. They are not
      under his control.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="On the Run:">
      Either due to his incompetence as a
      physician, or his religious affiliation, Silas is on the run
      from the local authorities. The PCs may be hired to track
      him down, or Silas may hire them as protection.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Fall Guy:">
      An Amorvin has discovered Silas and
      offered him great power and wealth if Silas will act on the
      Amorvin's behalf. Investigators into the Amorvin's crimes
      will find Silas instead.

        Derbis is lost, confused, and wants to go home. He is hungry
        as well, but then he is always hungry. Originally from
        Sherem, Derbis has only been on Hârn for a few weeks. All
        Derbis knows is that he was following the scent of some
        creature he had never encountered before (an Ivashu). The
        trail lead to a seldom visited section of the forest that
        made Derbis's head feel funny, after he lost the trail and
        tried to make his way home he discovered he was in a very
        strange land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost immediately after his arrival, Derbis encountered a
        band of gargun and tried to ask them where he was. Instead
        of talking the gargun attacked, after Derbis squished a
        bunch of them, the rest fled. Since then, he has encountered
        some human barbarians, but they either flee or attack,
        forcing Derbis to squish them or flee himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derbis belongs to a species of Ogre that uses a form of
        telepathy to communicate amongst themselves. Given a few
        days of association with anyone having an Aura of 12 or
        above, Derbis will gain a rudimentary grasp of their spoken
        language (SB2). So far he has not had an opportunity to do
        so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derbis is essentially a kind-hearted soul who would just
        like to go home, but does not know how to get there. He
        never threatens anyone, and only resorts to violence if
        violence is offered. He has given up trying to get back home
        by retracing his steps, as that was not effective on the
        first three tries. He has no concept of Barasi points,
        especially those that are only active at certain
        times.
      </p>
      <p>
        His tough skin equals one layer of leather, a combination of
        fur pelts and hides is equal to one layer of quilt plus
        another layer of leather. Notes: Impact - All weapons are
        larger than human equivalents and have double the
        impact. Added reach - Size and long arms mean that Derbis
        can hit opponents up to 10' away. This gives him a free
        tactical advantage as opponents close with him, unless they
        are using spears or other long weapons.

      <p>
        Matilda is the seventh and youngest child in a family of
        serfs living on a large and well man-aged manor
        estate. She has always been something of an
        &quot;odd&quot; child, and somewhat unpopular with her
        older siblings, though she is the apple of her mother's
        eye. Her mother arranged to get Matilda employment as a
        cook within the manor house, a position she started only a
        few weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matilda's mother has a psionic talent, and recognizes that
        her daughter is developing talents as well. She has
        cautioned Matilda to keep her powers hidden. Even her mother
        does not realize the true depth of Matilda's psionic
        potential. For the past four years, Matilda has been
        practicing her talents while tending to the sheep and goats,
        taking them to pastures unlikely to be visited by
        others. Matilda has a fondness for animals, and often adopts
        one as her pet. Her current pet is a young tomcat she has
        dubbed Sir Fuzzywhiskers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having grown up hearing folklore stories about Genin and
        the &quot;Wizard's Isle&quot;, it is Matilda's dream to go
        to Melderyn Island and become a Wizard. Since becoming a
        cook at the manor house, she has been working on a plan to
        fulfil her dream.

      <p>
        Melas Renier, as he is known in the human language is a
        Sindarin warrior who has walked Hârn for over 2000 years. He
        is a veteran of many battles, including the Battle of
        Sorrows. Melas has spent many centuries travelling
        throughout Hârn. Unlike the majority of his brethren, Melas
        finds humans to be fascinating creatures, capable of great
        things, as well as the lowest of the low. He feels that his
        people have stagnated, and that there is a lot that the
        Sindarin could learn from the humans if they would only open
        their eyes to the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melas can be found almost anywhere on Hârn, though he rarely
        stays in one place for long, at least in human terms. He may
        stay with a barbarian tribe for two or three years and call
        it a nice visit. On occasion he returns to the Shava forest
        to report his observations to the crown and anyone who will
        listen. Most other Sindarin consider him to be
        excentric. While he is almost entirely self sufficient,
        Melas has been known to need money for some reason or
        another. He occasionally enters archery contests during
        tournaments, and only one human archer, a Chybisan yeoman
        has beaten him in the last century.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melas knows the Uthrem Roliri, and they know him. Some of
        them are his descendants, from a half-Sindarin daughter born
        three centuries ago. He has trained many of the Uthrem
        Roliri and travelling with him for a few seasons is
        considered a great honour to the rangers. Melas does still
        have contacts amongst the Khuzan, and is one of the few
        sources of contact between the two peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        All his armor and weaponry is of Sindarin manufacture.
        Melas has gear cached in many places.

    <note type="hook" value="Bejist:">
      Melas has been watching the cultists at
      Bejist for some time. He has counselled the Sindarin crown
      that the cultists need to be removed, but no action has been
      taken. Melas is looking for a group that will assist him in
      eliminating the cultists. He has even considered approaching
      the Chybisan crown for aid.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Born in Golotha to a prostitute, Tobas of Sharvan spent his
        early years as a guttersnipe, cut purse and look out for the
        Lia-Kavair. If he had not tried to cut the purse of a
        travelling Viran from Shostim, Tobas might never have met
        his full potential. Detecting the great potential within the
        boy, the Viran offered Tobas a choice, to either apprentice
        at Shostim, or die. He chose the later. Tobas was a
        brilliant student and has become one of the most
        accomplished mages of his generation. In 702, Tobas was
        handpicked to become a member of the White Hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his apprenticeship, Tobas was given the nickname
        &quot;Wick&quot;, a moniker he still uses today among his
        closest friends and acquaintances. Tobas bears the burn
        scars on his hands, arms and left side from an early,
        catastrophic, psionic episode. Since 710, Tobas has
        travelled through Hârn on the trail of a notorious
        Melderyni renegade. He is credited with single-handedly
        bringing no less than seven renegades to justice but has
        yet to find the trail of his primary quarry. Tobas rarely
        travels alone, usually accompanying caravans or other
        large groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tobas is a member of the litigant's guild, and uses this as
        a cover while he is travelling, even taking cases
        periodically. He has developed a wide network of contacts
        throughout Hârn at all levels of society and uses them to
        gather information useful to his search.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his prodigious mastery of the Peleahn
        convocation, Tobas has great skill in a number of spells
        useful to his hunt. Some of these were learned through the
        study of written works and artefacts taken from fallen
        renegades. Tobas is always careful to report these items and
        turn them over to the proper chantries - eventually. In
        addition to his sword, dagger, ring, and amulet, Tobas may
        be found with almost any artefact that the GM deems
        appropriate to the encounter.

      A PC Shek P'var that has come
      close to or crossed the line might get a memorable, and
      terrifying visit from Tobas. He will give a warning for a
      first offence.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="A Litigant Needed:">
      The PCs need a litigant quickly,
      Tobas will take their case, but the cost may be high.

      Tobas investigates the PCs, believing
      they may have information useful to his search. The social

      will conceal his true nature.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Adventurers Needed:">
      Tobas has learned something
      useful and needs the information verified. He may actually
      be using the PCs as a decoy or stalking-horse.

      <p>
        Giles of Gilam is the son of a master ostler who is bonded
        to a prominent and wealthy nobleman. Giles's father has been
        conducting a warhorse-breeding program for his noble patron
        since becoming a master ostler. After twenty years, the
        horse farm has started producing warhorses of superior
        stamina, larger size, and the right temperament for
        war. Success has not come without some problems, and the
        nobleman has agreed to introduce some new blood into the
        line to correct these issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of his journeyman duties, Giles has been sent on a
        buying mission to locate horses with the qualities that are
        to be introduced into the bloodline. To aid him, Giles has a
        letter of introduction written by his patron noble, and
        letters that will allow him to draw on usurer funds at major
        cities. These letters of credit are only useable by someone
        who can offer the correct code phrase to the usurer. It has
        been impressed upon Giles the importance of keeping the code
        phrase secret. He is also using this trip to make contact
        with other ostlers. Once this mission is complete, he will
        be leaving home to study with other ostlers in order to
        achieve his master rank.
      </p>
      <p>
        Giles can be encountered at any of the major horse fairs or
        trade gatherings throughout Hârn. The Burzyn horse fair, the
        Chelni Gathering, Tashal, or wherever horses are to be
        found. He is predominantly interested in mares, but will
        purchase a stallion if it exhibits the right
        characteristics. At any given time, he may be found
        travelling with up to four horses.

      <p>
        Dame Barthy is the 26-year-old only child of Sir Edwin
        Barthy, Bailiff of Ovendel manor, Thelshire. Afaewynn's
        mother died in childbirth. Her father never remarried and
        raised her as somewhat of a tomboy - teaching her to ride
        and fight. At age 17, her father arranged a marriage to a
        knight in the Earl of Balim's household guard stationed at
        Kiban - a year later, he was killed in a riding accident
        while hunting. Afaewynn claimed her husband's horse, armor
        and weapons, and returned to Ovendel. After proving herself
        in combat against a group of brigands, she was knighted by a
        friend of the family and started fulfilling Ovendel's feudal
        levy in place of her aging father. An attractive woman,
        excellent rider and a competent warrior, she has
        considerable skill with a lance. Despite this, or because of
        it, few male knights will give her the time of day. She has
        little chance of marrying again.
      </p>
      <p>
        She attends tournaments out of a need to prove to the male
        knights that she is just as good as they are - if not
        better. Dame Barthy has an extreme dislike for Sir Kathel
        Dezaller of Loban, one of her goals is to beat him at the
        joust. If she is not confirmed as the bailiff of Ovendel, on
        the passing of her father, Dame Barthy will be without a
        means of support. She has set aside tournament winnings and
        made investments with the usurers in Tashal as an insurance
        policy. Afaewynn has developed a friendship with Dame Trina
        of Kallin, a Lady of Paladins Knight from Whyce manor. Dame
        Trina has encouraged Afaewynn to join the fighting
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Unless she has no other choice, Dame Barthy primarily
        fights from horseback.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        At 46 years of age, Sergeant Yerick is looking forward to
        retirement in a few years. He is the senior ranking Meken
        or common trooper at Jenkald, having served the Lady of
        Paladins for over thirty years, including ten years spent
        as an Erken or Chosen Man. The Sergeant is well liked by
        the knights of the order, and the experienced Meken. The
        new recruits live in fear of him, though some realize that
        the lessons he imparts now, no matter how harshly they are
        imparted, may save their lives later. Sergeant Yerick is
        almost never seen without his blackthorn knob walking
        stick, affectionately called &quot;The Motivator&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Age and past injuries have slowed the good sergeant down
        from his prime, but he is still a formidable
        warrior. Sergeant Yerick is also known for his well-crafted
        drawings, with subjects ranging from nature, buildings,
        villages, portraits, and heraldry. What few realize is that
        during his time as an Erken, Yerick travelled throughout
        Hârn covertly making drawings of the major fortifications
        throughout the island. These drawings were collected into a
        book, of which five copies were made, one for each of the
        Kaldoric Sword Chapters of the Lady of Paladins (LoP). The
        original is stored at Abriel Abbey in the restricted
        collection. These books are a closely guarded
        secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        If not for his penchant for fine ale, and lots of it,
        Sergeant Yerick would be the standard to which all Meken
        should aspire. As it is, he can hold a prodigious amount of
        ale, and on the rare occasions when he drinks too much, the
        other Turken take care of him, while the knights turn a
        blind eye. Yerick has been known to pay visit to some of the
        local ladies, but has never shown interest in
        marrying. Regardless of the activities of the night before,
        the Sergeant is always up at dawn, and Larani help any
        recruit not already at assembly waiting for him.

      <p>
        From Kaldor, Sam the Swift is a mercenary that can be
        encountered almost anywhere on Hârn. He is well known to the
        mercenary and caravan guard captains working the Salt
        Route. A handsome young man with a pleasant speaking voice,
        Sam is popular with the ladies, though few can claim to have
        shared a dalliance with him. Despite his slight frame and
        stature, he is a skilled warrior, often eschewing a shield
        in favour of wielding two short-swords simultaneously. As a
        mercenary, Sam travels widely, but tries to make it back to
        Kaldor on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is known to only a handful of people is that Sam the
        Swift is actually Sir Samuel of Zoben, a Lady of Paladins
        knight and covert agent in the service of Sir Houla of
        Artona, Reblana of Whyce. Sir Samuel was knighted in 718 to
        fulfil his father's dying wish. Samuel is the bastard son of
        a Lady of Paladins (LoP) knight and a physicians apprentice
        from Zoben. His mother raised him and he did not know who
        his father was until he was fourteen. He joined the LoP as a
        Meken (common soldier) recruit at age 15. Fighting beside
        his father at the battle of Yaltako in 718, he defended the
        injured knight with a sword in each hand. After the battle
        his father acknowledged Samuel as his son to the other
        knights. He asked that Samuel be knighted. Sir Houla
        (recognized an opportunity), knighted the young man, but
        immediately asked him to serve the LoP by acting as a
        spy. Sir Samuel accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        As proof of his noble status, Sir Samuel keeps a letter and
        cloth badge, indicating his status with the LoP secreted in
        an oilskin pouch inside the breastplate of his kurbul
        armor. Sir Samuel's missions are typically gathering
        information, crop yields, troop strength and quality,
        political alliances, and anything else of use to the
        LoP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Sir Samuel typically fights on foot.

      <p>
        Ylina is the product of an Orbaalese weaponcrafter and his
        Jarin war bride. Raised in the Sarajinian faith, Ylina
        became a shieldmaiden at age 15 after a drunken Ivinian
        sailor tried to take advantage of her and she killed him
        with his own shorkana. In 714, while visiting Lorkin, Ylina
        witnessed the brutality of Clan Geldestaar against the
        Jarin. She tried to intervene on the behalf of a Jarin
        woman, but was ultimately forced to flee Lorkin after
        killing one of Jaus Geldestaar's men.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since fleeing Lorkin Ylina has lost faith in Sarajin,
        stopped using her clan name, and started smuggling weapons
        to the Jarin. She has also honed her physical abilities into
        an impressive fighting trim, with almost no body fat. She is
        a creature of steel and whipcord, fuelled by anger. The only
        people she hates more than Clan Geldestaar are the Crimson
        Dancers. At a distance, Ylina is sometimes mistaken for an
        adolescent male.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ylina has contacts among the Jarin of Azadmere. They are the
        source of the weapons she smuggles to the Jarin of
        Orbaal. She has also gifted several Khuzan-made weapons to
        Noron to allow her and her goods safe passage through his
        territory. She typically moves weapons in small batches by
        mule, no more than one or two mules at a time. She usually
        portrays herself as a travelling weaponcrafter. Her skill in
        this area is not exceptional, but is adequate to keep up the
        pretence. She has been known to hire Taelda or others to
        help her move her cargo. Rebel groups pay her what they can
        and she sometimes moves stolen goods for them.

      <p>
        Otto is a product of the seedier aspects of the Thardic
        Republic. His parents were both Lia-Kavair and lay
        worshippers of Naveh in Shiran. Otto was trained as an
        assassin by the Naveh and made three kills at the order of
        the temple. If circumstances had been different, Otto may
        have been inducted into the priesthood, but he refused to
        kill the victim of his fourth assignment. As a test of
        Otto's dedication to Naveh the temple had named his sister
        as his fourth victim, he refused. Otto was sentenced to the
        Herth-Akan and survived, killing all seven of his
        pursuers. After this, he chose to leave Tharda, but still
        waits for the day the temple decides to send others to kill
        him. Otto still possesses two vials of Gethepa
        poison.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since leaving Tharda, Otto has made his way as a mercenary,
        spending three years with a company in Rethem before moving
        on. He can be encountered almost anywhere in Hârn, but
        prefers to stay away from Tharda, especially Shiran. Since
        leaving the mercenary company, Otto has predominantly worked
        as a bodyguard to wealthy merchants.
      </p>
      <p>
        He still enjoys &quot;the Hunt&quot; as he calls it, and
        if circumstances allow, will practice his stealth and
        stalking - only on one of these occasions has he actually
        taken the life of his target. Otto is considering his next
        move, with a goal of joining the ranks of the wealthy.

      <p>
        At 7' 2&quot; tall, weighing 288 pounds, Muga makes an
        impressive and intimidating figure. Afflicted with giantism,
        and an insatiable wanderlust, Muga left his homeland at 16
        to explore the world. He returns to his tribal range
        periodically to visit family and friends, but so far has
        chosen to continue his wandering ways. His stories of the
        wider world are popular around the campfires of the
        Anoa. His elderly mother would like him to settle
        down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often accused of being, or mistaken for, one of Noron's
        sons, Muga took it upon himself to visit Noron's keep and
        ask. Though they could not confirm any blood relationship,
        Noron and his brood took a liking to Muga, and they count
        each other as friends. In his youth, Muga found a shortsword
        after the Ovien River flooded and exposed some old Jarin
        burial mounds. Noron has told him that the blade is
        enchanted. Muga once broke his spear fighting Fana gargun
        attacking the Silver Way Caravan; a grateful member of clan
        Dyrak gave him a new one. He considers the sword and his
        Khuzan spear to be his prize possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Muga often hires on as a caravan scout or guard, though he
        will not work a caravan going through Anoa territory. His
        size and impressive wilderness and combat skills make him a
        welcome addition to any caravan, because of this he can be
        encountered almost anywhere. He will not stay in large
        cities such as Tashal, preferring to remain outside the
        walls. If he does have business inside the city, he will
        conduct it as quickly as possible and retreat back to his
        camp. When not serving a caravan, Muga travels the wilds of
        North East Hârn alone. Visiting Noron, friends among the
        Taelda, Leriel, Zerhun, or his home near the foot of the
        Jahl Mountains. He has been known to serve as a scout and
        guide for small groups, or for military patrols, especially
        along the Silver Way.

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Dramin Naradas was not a nice man. Like his father, he was
        an animal trainer. They captured bears in the forest and
        raised them under horrible conditions. His clan also raised
        and trained hunting dogs. At fairs and market days, they
        would parade the helpless bears through town and then chain
        them to a stake and set the dogs upon them for the amusement
        of the crowd. People would bet. How many dogs would the bear
        kill? Would the bear survive? One day, they got a bear that
        wouldn't fight, a scared little female. She just lay
        whimpering while the dogs attacked her. The crowds
        booed. His father was furious and slit the bear's
        throat. Dramin dropped his whip and walked away. He has
        never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that fateful day, Dramin has become a changed
        man. Now, he spends his time with horses and mules. He has
        developed a new technique, based on patient slow movements
        and soft whispers, to earn their trust. Despite the obvious
        results he has achieved with even the most stubborn animals,
        people think he is cracked. The Ostler's Guild will have
        nothing to do with him. Deprived of the only living he knew,
        Dramin wandered for several years, doing odd jobs here and
        there. Finally, a penny-pinching bureaucrat named Andel
        Gebar, the Permanent Secretary of the Chief Clerk of the
        Exchequer, hired him. Too cheap to hire a real ostler, Andel
        hired Dramin as a servant, but gave him responsibility for
        tending his two fine palfreys and four mules. Andel likes to
        travel in style, displaying his power and position. The
        horses and mules have been in fine shape ever since he was
        hired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dramin works with the Permanent Secretary's other full
        time servant, Riatha, the cook. She takes care of the
        cooking and cleaning. He carries the baggage, fetches
        water, cuts wood and does the heavy physical labor. A shy,
        retiring man, Dramin has fallen for his co-worker. His
        love and devotion to her are obvious to all. Although
        Dramin has renounced violence towards animals, years
        baiting animals in the ring have given him reflexes and
        combat skills which most would never suspect. He would
        kill to protect Riatha or &quot;his&quot; horses and
        mules...and even Andel if he happened to be riding one of
        them.

      <p>
        In 714, on the recommendation of a &quot;friend&quot;,
        Andel Gebar, Permanent Secretary to the Chief Clerk of the
        Exchequer, hired Riatha as his servant. She acts as his
        cook, body servant, chambermaid and washerwoman. Riatha
        has proven to be an excellent choice. She is friendly,
        outgoing, happy go lucky and is always quick with the
        complement. Her approachability, empathy and pleasant
        voice quickly lull people into her confidence. She is
        &quot;loyal,&quot; never talks back, does her chores
        quickly and efficiently and without complaint. Although
        she is &quot;illiterate&quot; and &quot;not too
        bright,&quot; that is to be expected of a simple serving
        woman. She is a good cook and works cheaply; those are the
        most important things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Riatha's appearance, mannerisms and demeanor are skilled
        deceptions. She is actually a priestess of Naveh and a
        covert agent. Kidnapped as an infant, she was raised in
        the church. During the ritual stalking combat to become a
        priestess, she was stabbed in the right ear, causing her
        to become deaf on that side. She gutted her opponent
        without mercy or second thought. After becoming a
        priestess, the Garana (High Priest) dispatched her to
        infiltrate the royal bureaucracy. She provides detailed
        intelligence about persons and activities within the court
        through covert contacts. Riatha rarely drops her act, even
        during infrequent moments of complete privacy, always
        conscious that someone could discover her. Twice, she has
        been forced to act quickly and decisively to
        &quot;tie-up&quot; loose ends (including an overly
        inquisitive man-at-arms). She is skilled with a dagger,
        though poison is her preferred weapon. Andel is complete
        unaware that Riatha has addicted him to Leortevald, a rare
        poison for which withdrawal is fatal. She doses him
        regularly. Should something happen to her, he will die
        within the week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for Riatha, her life has recently taken an
        unexpected and perplexing twist. Andel hired a new servant,
        Dramin. For the first time in her life, she has met someone
        who truly cares for her, awakening conflicting and
        previously unknown feelings. This scares her, because even
        if personally ordered by the Garana, she could never harm
        Dramin.

        The gentle gardener and herbalist who lives with Merrimam at
        Frylus' Den is a tall man with thinning hair and the large
        hands of one accustomed to heavy labor. He is sometimes
        overheard addressing his flowers and herbs and the various

        This ex-slave is a very different person from the serious,

        talented son and grandson of popular gladiators. His
        specialty was beasts and the crowds gossiped that he knew
        their minds before they did. By age 22 he was well known and
        popular in the Coranan arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 709TR, his master sent him into the ring in a fight to
        the death, as he had many times before. This time, something
        was wrong. The crowd was heavy with expectation; Anax knew
        some evil was afoot. His opponent wore a full-face helm, as
        did he. The fight was hard. His opponent was older and
        slower, but also experienced and wily. All during the bout,
        Anax couldn't shake the feeling that his opponent was
        familiar; there was something about the way he moved. After
        half-a-glass, both men neared exhaustion, when the other
        gladiator stepped on a bone, twisting his ankle. Anax seized
        the opportunity and delivered the killing blow, decapitating
        his foe. When the head rolled out of the helm, it was his
        father.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experience changed the young gladiator forever. The
        killer instinct drained out of him, with his father's blood,
        onto the arena floor. But for the intervention of a foreign
        astrologer, who had won a handsome purse on that very bout,
        Anax knows he would have died, a broken man, in his very
        next fight. Merrimam bought the gladiator and set him
        free. Anax foreswore the arena and all unnecessary
        violence. He started attending Peonian services and has
        slowly made peace with his past. Merrimam offered him a
        manservant position in his household, which Anax loyally
        fills to this day. Despite his newly discovered inner peace,
        he remains a skilled fighter and the Astrologer's devoted
        and deadly bodyguard.

      The PCs see thieves attempt to mug a
      servant carrying a shovel. In a dozen heartbeats, before
      they can even intervene, the servant deftly disables all
      four men. The town guard quickly seizes him. Later, Merrimam
      approaches the PCs to be witnesses for the defence. No one

      <p>
        A simple dream, a lamb starving and lost, bleating for its
        mother, is the reason Ryke Hamm is alive today. The son of a
        shepherd, Ryke ran away from home at a young age. After
        working in a mine for a year and a day to earn his freedom,
        he struck out for the big city with dreams of fame and
        fortune. Reality was less kind. Alone, uneducated, with few
        skills, he was soon reduced to begging in the streets. The
        morning after dreaming of the lamb, Merrimam the Astrologer
        found Ryke, starving, delirious and clutching a shepherd's
        crook, lying on his doorstep. Never one to ignore a sign
        from the gods, Merrimam had his servant bring the man into
        the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anax, Merrimam's servant, fed Ryke and nursed him back to
        health. He was permitted to sleep in the shed for a few
        days and regain his strength. Then, Merrimam tested
        him. He offered Ryke a farthing to take his two goats to
        graze on the commons. Merrimam knew the value of the goats
        and value of a man in need of a second chance. Ryke
        returned that evening leading two fat and happy
        goats. With the Astrologer's patronage, Ryke was soon
        herding the animals of many other guildsmen. With steady
        work, he was able to rent a small flop and buy food. All
        Merrimam asked in return was for Ryke to keep his eyes and
        ears open for &quot;interesting news.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Fat&quot; gets his moniker from his favorite
        pastime, nervous habit, and source of nutrition - a
        well-chewed piece of salt pork that often dangles from his
        lips, dripping the juicy melting lard into his beard. It
        flaps about when he talks, doing nothing to improve his
        complex and unorthodox diction. He brews a peculiar
        concoction of meadow herbs and fungi which he claims gives
        him endurance and strength, but even the thirstiest
        villager has no interest in sipping from his crude
        wood-stoppered jug.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hamm is an excellent woodcarver, creating things of weird
        beauty with a sharp knife and local wood. Perhaps most
        unusual are his little heads; Ryke carves humorous
        likenesses of people he has seen into small wooden balls no
        bigger than a thumb. Each includes a hole to make it whistle
        when shot through the air with his leather sling. He claims
        the whistle ensures it flies straight and true to his
        favorite target, just in front of the ear. The wood is hard
        enough to render the victim unconscious but light enough to
        avoid concussion or further injury.

      <p>
        Unassuming and unthreatening, there is more to Reld than
        meets the eye. He is one of the most widely traveled men on
        all of Hârn. He has visited Melderyn, Chybisa, Kaldor,
        Orbaal, Tharda, Kanday and even the closed kingdoms of
        Azadmere (Zerhun) and Evael (Ulfshafen). He considered
        visiting Rethem, but decided, for his own safety, against
        it. Reld has an eidetic memory and is able to recall in
        vivid detail anything (or place) he has ever seen. From
        memory, he can draw very accurate maps of his travels. The
        detailed and exciting accounts of his many adventures are
        extremely popular wherever he goes and have often earned him
        his supper and a warm bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Far ranging expeditions have turned Reld into a skilled and
        hardened traveler. He is comfortable on the road, in the
        wilderness or in a town. He can forage for food and survive
        most wilderness challenges. The threat of footpads, thieves
        and brigands has forced him to learn how to defend himself
        with the dagger or staff, but he remains an essentially
        peaceful and non-confrontational fellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he has grown older, his wanderlust has diminished. Four
        years ago, he accepted a position as private scribe to the
        Permanent Secretary of the Chief Clerk of the Exchequer,
        Andel Gebar. This gave him a regular salary and a decent
        roof over his head, while still allowing him some travel
        (within the kingdom). Andel has come to depend on the
        flawless memory of his new scribe. Recognizing his value
        to his new master, Reld negotiated a substantial increase
        in wages and a cut of all of the &quot;gifts&quot; Andel
        receives from the manors he visits. Reld has invested his
        earnings in several diverse enterprises, which will
        support a very comfortable retirement.

      The PCs are starting up a
      speculative venture. Reld has heard about it and thinks it
      will do well. He has some extra money (a fairly sizeable
      amount) he wants to invest. He will take a long hard look at
      each of the PCs. If they cross him, they will find very
      detailed wanted posters circulated through the Sheriffs and
      other royal bureaucracy.

      important, but now Reld knows too much.

      <p>
        The tall, narrow house with the two round windows is home to
        Merrimam the Nightwalker, an accomplished astrologer and
        guilded arcanist. Merrimam's expertise is unquestioned; he
        has made a small fortune investing in carefully selected
        risky ventures and now his services are in great demand
        among the nobility and the wealthier members of the
        Mercantylers' Guild.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merrimam is a silent partner with a local mercantyler, and
        majority owner of the Crynto, a 48' seagoing nivik. The
        parlor of his home, called Frylus' Den, is a crossroads for
        men and women of all classes and cultures who share a common
        need to know what the future holds, and the means to gain
        Merrimam's insights. He is a mysterious man, sometimes
        feared, and often referred to obliquely as the King of
        Wands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merrimam is a scholar of long experience, and even as a
        young man was more interested in old tomes than in young
        women. He is unmarried, sharing his townhouse with a
        bodyguard and two cats. He is a member in good standing of
        the church of Save K'nor and grants considerable gifts of
        silver and esoterica to the abbey at Vil in Melderyn, where
        his close friend, Ferech, is a Rowanti. In addition to
        Hârnic, Merrimam reads and speaks Trierzi and his native
        Emela. He reads High Azeryani, Byrian, Numer, Old Panhaonic,
        and ancient Hepeka in the Hekori script, but he speaks none
        of them except High Azeryani and Byrian, and those only with
        effort. He has mastered the Selenian script, but his
        knowledge of Sindarin is limited to what he has found in
        astrological treatises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merrimam has the resources and opportunity to indulge his
        passion for research. He has assembled an informal
        association of friends who can provide the physical skills
        he lacks, or who can gain access to places where he would
        attract unwelcome attention. With their assistance, Merrimam
        has been able to solve a number of mysteries, and to uncover
        many more.

      <p>
        Mysterious and secretive, Gravith of Dray has few he would
        call friends. His intimate knowledge of the many and
        varied &quot;faces of death&quot; and the unfortunate odor
        of corpses, which linger on his skin and clothes, inspire
        fear and revulsion in the uneducated. Rumors that he is a
        disciple of Morgath or Naveh surface regularly. His
        antisocial nature and gruff tone do little to quell the
        stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fourth generation embalmer, he learned his trade from
        his father. A bad limp, caused by a horse kick when he was
        a boy, and a slight stoop made him an object of ridicule
        and scorn as a child, resulting in his poor social
        skills. At nineteen, while picking up the body of a dead
        criminal at the local castle, he observed the lord
        torturing a captured spy. Innocently, Gravith piped up
        &quot;you will kill him if you keep doing that.&quot;
        Intrigued, the lord asked Gravith when he would do, and
        soon, he was the official torturer. He conducted many
        experiments on unwilling victims. They all talked in the
        end. As a result, he developed a clearer understanding of
        death and dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, Gravith tired of torture; there was no more it
        could teach him. He began to study medicine, herbs and
        healing, eventually working as a field surgeon for a rather
        down-on-their-luck mercenary unit who couldn't afford a real
        physician. This taught him a great deal about weapons and
        the wounds they inflict. The function and frailty of the
        human body still fascinate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today he maintains an honest franchise and is moderately
        active in his guild and in the Mangai. He lives and works
        alone; he has almost no ability to connect emotionally with
        other human beings and many shun him socially, but none deny
        his ability, or the unseemly joy he seems to find in his
        morbid work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gravith's knowledge of dead bodies and the many ways they
        can reach that state has been instrumental in solving a
        number of mysterious deaths investigated by the Pentacle. He
        appreciates the opportunity to put his skills to work in a
        productive way, and he truly values the few friendships he
        has acquired through the Astrologer.

      While investigating a mystery, the

      the event, but if the PCs watch him they will see him

    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The brawny, weathered seaman, born Paguris of Speh and now
        known on the docks as &quot;Monk&quot;, has made a good
        life for himself after starting on stormy seas. Abandoned
        as boys, Paguris and his little brother Carex grew up amid
        the sodden straw and stained tables of an unlicensed
        tavern on the waterfront. Able and enterprising lads
        blessed with uncommon balance and agility, the local Lia
        Kavair put them to work. Carex attained a degree of
        notoriety in the city, but Monk was disgusted by the filth
        and close horizons of his world and his peers. He fled to
        the sea aboard a Dak from Chelemby and was not seen in his
        home city for over ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The years at sea were good for Monk. He became a respected
        able seaman who could always find work on good ships bound
        for exciting and distant ports. It was on one of these that
        he met a most unusual passenger, a city man who knew the
        stars as well as he, and tales of the
        constellations. Merrimam was, like Monk, an explorer at
        heart, returning from far Anzeloria with a caged ape and
        botanical specimens, trophies not unlike what Monk had
        gathered during odd moments of liberty in foreign
        ports.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they watched Crynto the Beetle rise over the flickering
        lights of Tarkain, Merrimam recognized Monk's restless
        intelligence had been thwarted by the shackles of the life
        he'd been born into. But before they made port, pirates
        took the ship. The story of the pirate attack is by now
        well known in the taverns and stew-houses of the city. The
        hilarious climax, with the infamous &quot;Mad Monkey
        Gambit&quot;, that turned the tables on the pirates
        earning Monk his nickname. Merrimam was able to purchase
        the vessel, which he renamed the Crynto in honor of his
        friend. Monk now serves as the ship's chief bosun.

      The PCs need crewmen for their ship. Monk
      applies. He is a fully qualified Able Seaman (AB) with good
      references. He makes a solid Bosun.

      The PCs are involved in a barbrawl on the waterfront. One of
      them is about to be hit from behind when Monk intervenes and
      knocks their attacker unconscious. He helps them escape,
      showing a great deal of knowledge of the &quot;secrets&quot;
      of the docks. It seems strange that such an upstanding
      fellow should have such knowledge. He tells them of his
      misspent youth.

    <note type="hook" value="The Astrologer's Companions.">
      The PCs come into conflict with Merrimam the
      Astrologer. Late one night they receive a visit from Monk,
      Cat and Anax, informing them that they should &quot;push
      off&quot;. If they refuse the hint, things will get very
      ugly. Monk has many friends in the Seaman's Guild. Accidents
      happen.

      <p>
        Carex of Speh, called the &quot;Cat&quot;, grew up the son
        and apprentice of a struggling thatcher. A clever,
        energetic lad with an uncanny sense of balance and the
        ability to cling to the most treacherous surfaces, the
        family achieved a fair degree of prosperity before his
        father was killed in a bad landing from an otherwise
        routine fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carex, and his equally agile older brother Paguris, were
        abandoned by their mother and taken in by the
        Lia-Kavair. Paguris eventually escaped to the sea, but
        Carex found his new friends had use for his talents. He
        undertook ever more difficult tasks, even burgling some
        wealthy homes others considered impenetrable. Whispers
        around the city referred to &quot;the cat that steals the
        sleep of honest men&quot; and young Carex, it must be
        admitted, grew fond of the notoriety.
      </p>
      <p>
        One moonless night as he entering a tall, narrow house
        through a round window, Cat was bitten by a large
        spider. His left hand burned and swelled as the venom took
        effect and began to spread. A lantern was uncovered,
        revealing Merrimam and his hulking serving man, Anax. By the
        end of a long, heartfelt conversation, Carex had a healthy
        hand, Anax had a spider in a box, and Merrimam had a new
        associate. The Astrologer persuaded Carex to turn his
        natural talents back to legal activities by investing (as a
        silent partner) in a new business, retiling roofs with slate
        or terra cotta. Carex finds the legitimate work much less
        exciting than his previous endeavors (though profitable
        enough), and is always happy to come out of retirement when
        the seer's investigations require his feline
        assistance.

      The PCs return to their residence to discover several of
      their most valuable possessions are gone. Carex is back to
      his old tricks again. A quick investigation reveals a rash
      of recent thefts, all through high windows or smoke
      holes. Can they catch this slippery thief? He has probably
      already fenced their belongings (a good way for the GM to
      &quot;relieve&quot; the PCs of excess items).
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="What A Charming Fellow.">
      The PCs meet a handsome and dashing young man in a
      tavern. He is friendly, funny and quickly makes friends,
      especially with any ladies. He sweeps them off their feet
      with his fine dancing and plies the men with bawdy jokes and
      ale. The next time they go to use a special item; it (and
      only it) is missing. The &quot;Cat&quot; strikes again.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="We Need Someone For A 'Special Job.'">
      The PCs need to get into a building without being
      detected. They don't have the skill needed, but a
      &quot;friend&quot; refers them to just the man. For the
      right price, the &quot;Cat&quot; will come out of
      retirement, for a hefty fee and the thrill of the chase.

      <p>
        The son of a prominent and wealthy mercantyler, Andel had
        the finest education, tutored by the priests of the local
        temple of Save K'nor. At sixteen, he began a mercantyler
        apprenticeship. Although he proved himself an excellent
        agent and sharp negotiator, as fourth son, there was little
        hope he would ever become more than a bonded
        master. Instead, with his father's blessing, he entered the
        royal bureaucracy as a clerk. He has risen through the ranks
        to the position of Permanent Secretary to the Chief Clerk of
        the Exchequer, who is generally a political appointee with
        little, if any, knowledge of the actual workings of his
        department.
      </p>
      <p>
        The department of the Chief Clerk of the Exchequer is
        responsible for keeping track of the King's many and
        varied holdings. While they do not collecting the taxes,
        they do inspect, inventory and, most importantly, assess
        the value of all of the King's property. Since feudal
        payments and taxes are based on these assessments and
        records, this is an important position. An appointee, most
        Chief Clerks leave the job of actually visiting the King's
        manors, conducting the assessments and preparing the
        reports to their Permanent Secretary, giving Andel a huge
        amount of power and plentiful opportunities to accept
        generous &quot;gifts&quot;. He is much feared by the
        King's bailiffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man in middle life, solid, unwrinkled, intelligent,
        passive, non-committal; polite in contact but at the same
        time unresponsive, cool, calm and composed, Andel is the
        master of obfuscation and manipulation. A silky-smooth
        senior civil servant he has a treasure trove of baffling
        phrases, paradoxical reasoning and enigmatic
        explanations. Andel maintains a deferent but adversarial
        relationship with the Chief Clerk, but is committed to
        seeing he never meddles too much in the daily business of
        the department and that the real power remains securely in
        the hands of the &quot;professional&quot; clerks and,
        therefore, of himself.

      One of the PCs has recently been

      <p>
        The youngest son of a Laranian yeoman, Kernt hated
        farming. He felt there must be something more to life than
        looking at the ass-end of a cow all day long. He threw
        himself into militia training and proved to be reasonably
        skilled. When he was seventeen, he took leave of his parents
        and headed out into the world. He had great dreams of
        becoming a Meken (common man-at-arms) of the Laranian Order
        of the Chequered Shield. He hiked to one of their chapter
        houses and presented himself. Surprisingly, he was allowed
        to join as a probationary acolyte (there had been a lot of
        casualties fighting the Rethemi that year). However, he
        didn't make it past the first month. All that praying got on
        his nerves. Since he had taken no permanent vows, he was
        free to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        His militia training and brief flirtation with the fight
        order gave him a taste for fighting and he soon found
        himself a job with a small mercenary company. The first few
        years were hard (he was nearly killed several times), but he
        soon acquired better weapons and armor and began to earn a
        little money. Four years ago, when the company dissolved for
        lack of contracts, he hit the road again, eventually meeting
        Petin in a tavern. Andel's other guard had just died
        mysteriously and Petin was looking for a replacement. After
        a short trial bout in the courtyard (to prove his skills),
        he was hired. Kernt has been working as Andel's bodyguard
        ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is good. Kernt's job with Andel includes food, lodging
        and steady, if not spectacular, pay. A skilled gambler,
        Kernt supplements his pay with his winnings at dice and
        games of chance. He gets along well with Petin, Dramin and
        Reld. However, there is something about Riatha he can't put
        his finger on. Andel is just a pompous pain in the
        ass. Kernt wouldn't die defending him.
      </p>

        To my friend Paul Barr, who, in answer to the question
        &quot;What should HWG do next&quot; responded, &quot;Why not
        something involving the great Mr. Mould in a Hârnic
        persona?&quot; Well Paul, be careful what you wish for!

      One night in the tavern, Kernt
      offers to play dice with one or two of the PCs. He loses
      regularly, but slowly and steadily wins more than he loses,
      eventually taking a tidy sum from the PCs. Are the dice
      loaded? Petin will back him (he is getting a cut) if a fight
      breaks out.

      quietly in the back row, not causing any problems. He

      Andel caught Kernt gambling (again), and

      One of the PCs has been accused of a crime. He has been thrown
      into the castle dungeon where Jehan is the jailer. Assisted by
      two strapping guards, Jehan proceeds to interrogate the PC. Can
      the PC resist his ministrations?

      A nobleman has been arrested on suspicion of treason. His family
      claims he is innocent, but fears for his life. They hire the PCs

    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Taking Work Home.">
      There have been a number of disappearances in town over the last
      few months. Gossip centers on Jehan, who was recently dismissed
      for killing too many valuable prisoners. He lives in a house on
      the edge of town and recently dug a deep, soundproof cellar
      beneath it.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The fourth son of a successful farming family, Jehan had
        little hope of an inheritance, a fact his eldest brother
        lorded over him. Jehan had no desire to end up as a glorified
        servant, toiling away for his brother, and so was determined
        to find a way off the farm.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Jehan was 20, he lucked into a job as the jailer in his
        liege's keep. His cousin was the sergeant in charge of the
        castle garrison. When the jailer died after slipping on a wet
        stair and cracking his head open, the sergeant recommended
        Jehan for the job. The job was easy, paid well, and got him
        off the farm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several months into the job, an accused murderer was thrown in
        the dungeon. Since the baron didn't have a torturer, he
        ordered Jehan to see what he could get out of the man. Using
        tools left by his predecessor, Jehan began to interrogate the
        prisoner. He quickly got a full confession, much to the
        baron's delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        More important to Jehan than the confession was that he
        discovered he liked inflicting pain. He was soon practicing on
        every prisoner he could. Over the last three years, he has
        developed into a full-blown sadist.  He inflicts pain just for
        the joy of it. He has earned a reputation as a brutal but
        effective interrogator. His specialties are hot irons, partial
        drowning, and the rack.  Although not particularly tall or
        muscular, Jehan has a certain wildness about his eyes that
        strikes fear in the hearts of his subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        His growing reputation brought him to the attention of his
        master's liege lord, who asked for his services.  Jehan has
        moved to the earl's castle, where he now has access to even
        more victims

        Rakoczi of Aymar is a well-known and experienced alchemist. He
        has been active in the local community for many years and
        actually produced some effective rotes (recipes), at least as
        far as his clients were concerned.  These include several
        potions that he claims will make the user more charismatic and
        powerful, fall in love, or live longer. His most important
        discovery was a formula for making a rare, bright blue dye
        that worked better than the commonly used woad. This earned
        him quite a bit of money and has allowed him to pursue his
        true goal, the transmutation of lead to gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Rakoczi's primary course of research involves
        the repeated vaporization and condensation of quicksilver onto
        lead ingots. In the course of his experimentation, he has used
        large quantities of mercury. Because he closely monitors all
        of the steps in the process, he has handled and inhaled
        dangerously large quantities of mercury.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last three years, the mercury has begun to seriously
        affect Rakoczi's health. It started with pink cheeks,
        fingertips, and toes. Then came swelling, shedding of skin,
        profuse sweating, increased salivation, muscle weakness,
        sensitivity to light, and loss of hair, teeth, and nails. Most
        recently, he has started to display tremors, impaired
        cognitive skills, insomnia, frequent mood swings, and
        forgetfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of his ranting and raving, bizarre behaviour, and
        irrational actions, the locals are convinced he is going
        insane. Despite this, he seems to have an unending supply of
        gold. His neighbours think he may have discovered
        transmutation.

        Seelie is the local apothecary and midwife. She is married to
        the local miller and they have two sons.  Seelie is a free
        spirit and does much to balance her husbandÃ¢s tendency to be
        a stern disciplinarian and excessively serious. The success of
        their two franchises has made them quite wealthy. They have a
        large, comfortable, two-story stone house next to the
        mill. The family lives upstairs while the main floor is
        Seelie's shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seelie is a fourth-generation apothecary. Her mother, a
        renowned apothecary and midwife in her own time, taught her
        many closely guarded family recipes for wines, syrups,
        cordials, and medicines. These tried and true products make
        Seelie the most trusted and successful apothecary in the area,
        with customers traveling long distances to purchase her
        products.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front part of Seelie's shop has shelves full of medicines
        and herbs. The back section is where she prepares medicines
        when they are required. Many of her recipes are made on
        request so that they are as fresh and potent as possible. She
        also keeps a large garden, where she grows the herbs and
        plants needed to prepare her cures. During the spring, summer,
        and fall, she spends two to three days a week in the woods and
        fields gathering ingredients for various cures. The rest of
        her time is split between looking after her large garden of
        special plants and tending to her patients. In the absence of
        a physician, Seelie is often called upon to diagnose and cure
        various illnesses. She also acts as the community midwife and
        tends to most births.

      The lord of the manor is old and intimidated by the PCs. Jamys
      and the yeoman are called in to support the old knight. The
      miller is not impressed by the PCs. He is a skilled fighter with
      many powerful friends, someone not to be crossed.

    <note type="hook" value="Unexpected Aid.">
      The PCs are attacked on the road (by brigands, gargun,
      etc.). They are outnumbered and losing badly. Jamys, several
      yeomen, and a dozen militiamen show up out of the blue, shifting
      the odds in the PCs favour. The miller says his son told him
      they were on the road and needed his help.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Old Friend.">
      Jamys has many friends in the Lady of Paladins and the Laranian
      church. One of his friends says Jamys can be trusted to shelter
      and assist them, no questions asked. All they need to do is
      mention the phrase "Not all who wander are lost".
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The second son of a miller, Jamys was never supposed to
        inherit his father's mill. At 17, he joined the Laranian
        fighting order, the Lady of Paladins, as a meken (common
        soldier). A natural warrior, he rose through the ranks quickly
        and became an ataken (common squire) at 23. Jamys' military
        career was progressing well when his older brother, who was
        working the family mill, slipped and fell into the millrace,
        was swept into the millwheel, and drowned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elis, Jamys' elderly father, was devastated. He had intended
        to hand over the franchise to his eldest son the following
        year. Now, without an heir, he feared his family would lose
        its franchise. He called Jamys home.  Family loyalty trumped
        career aspirations and Jamys resigned from the Lady of
        Paladins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jamys returned home and completed his journeyman
        training. While completing his qualifications, Jamys married
        his childhood sweetheart, the local apothecary. They had two
        sons, in 709 and 712 TR. Elis passed away shortly after their
        second child was born, leaving the mill to Jamys. Resigned to
        spending the rest of his life as a miller, Jamys has
        transferred his martial aspirations to his eldest son,
        fostering him as a page to his old master, a retired Lady of
        Paladins knight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jamys is a competent and scrupulously honest miller.  He is
        stern and efficient, running his business like he was still on
        the battlefield. He still practices his combat skills daily
        and is the leader of the village militia. Jamys stays in
        contact with his old friends in the order and is close friends
        with several of the priests from the nearby Laranian abbey.

      The daughter of a powerful lord (anywhere on Hârn) has heard of
      this exciting new actor. She insists he be brought to perform
      for her. She will not stop asking. Her father hires the PCs to
      find this actor and bring him back, willing or not. Ideally, the
      PCs are to bring the whole troupe.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        "Bors and the Wolfmen" are the best known and probably the
        most talented group of players in eastern Hârn. They are known
        for their powerful dramatic roles and are in high demand for
        romantic tragedies and religious plays. Their leader, Bors of
        Halle, is demanding, talented, and arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bors was born just a half a league from Tashal in Caleme, the
        seat of the archbishop of Kaldor. Bors' first memories are of
        watching a religious play in the massive Laranian temple. He
        was fascinated by the actors' ability to become different
        people. From that point on, Bors never missed a single play,
        no matter how horrible it was. He loved to hang around
        backstage, listening and watching the actors change costumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 14, Bors' father wanted him to become an apprentice ostler
        and follow into the family business. Bors refused and ran away
        to Tashal to become an actor. His father tracked him down
        without much difficulty and brought him home. After five such
        attempts, Bors' father acquiesced and let him go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bors was a natural actor and worked his way up through a
        number of theater companies. He quickly developed a reputation
        as the best actor in eastern Hârn and commanded healthy
        fees. He used this money to establish his own theater
        company. The name "Wolfmen" comes from their ability to shed
        their own skin and adopt the form of another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with talent and skill has come arrogance.  Bors is
        notoriously high maintenance and makes outrageous demands on
        his clients. Only his immense popularity has allowed him to
        become so self-indulgent.

    <note type="hook" value="Ouch!">
      The PCs are walking through the community.  They make a coarse
      remark about one of the villagers and suddenly one of them is
      hit by something hard and fast, an acorn. They catch a glimpse
      of a child disappearing down an alleyway.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Gargun are Coming.">
      The PCs come across a strange scene. A father is being badgered
      by his young son who insists that "the evil orcs are coming, I
      know it." That evening, sure enough, a raiding party attacks the
      village. How did the boy know?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Shadow.">
      While travelling through the woods, the PCs get the
      uncomfortable feeling that someone or something is watching
      them. At first, they may think that they are being followed by
      an elf or sprite.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Berik is the son of the village miller and apothecary.  Ever
        since he was crawling, everyone has called Berik "Mouse,"
        because he was as fast and slippery as a little mouse. Nobody
        calls him Berik except his brother, and then only to taunt
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being the son of wealthy commoners, Mouse is almost
        always barefoot and dressed in cheap, coarse linen shirt and
        leggings, leading many to mistake him for a common street
        urchin or waif. His mother simply refuses to have another good
        shirt ruined by his annoying habit of crawling down holes,
        wading in creeks, and generally getting filthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The younger of two boys, Mouse is a free spirit and takes
        after his mother. He spends his time in the woods or playing
        with the other children in the village. While his brother was
        learning to read, ride, and spar with his father, Mouse was
        shadowing his mother through the forest or playing hide and
        seek throughout the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mouse is young and flexible. He has developed some remarkable
        climbing and stealth skills. He is an absolute terror with his
        sling and, more than once, his father has had to deal with
        irate neighbours who have come under fire from his acorn
        ammunition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his physical skills, Mouse has a peculiar air
        about him, leading some to gossip that he's actually a
        Sindarin child, switched at birth. Berik has never told
        anyone, not even his mother, that he sometimes sees or dreams
        things before they happen. This ability seems to give him an
        amazing aptitude for getting in and out of trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes: Berik has not yet reached his full strength; add +1 STR
        every three years until he reaches age 20 (Str 12). His
        height, weight and frame will change as well.

      do it tonight. Meet me in the alley when the moon is at its

      <p>
        Onfroi was born into a large but struggling family of urban
        poor. The youngest of 13 children, Onfroi lived in a tiny,
        two-room apartment. His parents worked long hours, his father
        as a labourer and his mother as a washer-woman, but there was
        never enough to eat. He and his sister started begging when he
        was just four.
      </p>
      <p>
        Onfroi would do tricks, including balancing on his head,
        flips, and cartwheels. Soon they had a regular street corner,
        were paying protection money to the Lia-Kavair, and bringing
        in more than their mother did.  Onfroi graduated to more and
        more elaborate skills, learning to juggle and throw
        daggers. He started juggling balls but slowly expanded to
        include torches, axes and daggers; he eventually learned to
        juggle up to six items at a time. At 16, Onfroi left the
        family home to become a full-time busker. He lived with some
        friends at first, but within a year was able to afford a small
        oneroom tenement by himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        His hometown provided him a subsistence level of income, but
        each year it got harder to impress people who had seen him
        performing on the same street corner since he was a
        child. Onfroi noticed that the traveling performers who came
        to town with the caravans for the fairs made more than he did
        because of their novelty.  He decided to leave his
        hometown. With no idea of anything outside of his community,
        he hooked up with a traveling carnival. He spent several years
        with them even though the carnival master skimmed double what
        the Lia-Kavair had demanded. Once he had traveled the roads
        and knew the circuit, Onfroi struck out on his own.

      The PCs require some information. Their usual sources have been
      less than helpful. One of the PCs remembers a tutor he knew as a
      child. Wybert has an extensive private library and might be able
      to help, for a price.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="I Require Assistance.">
      An academic-looking man approaches the PCs and introduces
      himself. He is looking to hire escorts. He has just found out
      the father of the two noble youths he is traveling with has been
      killed in a feud. The men-at-arms that were escorting them have
      run off and they need an escort back to the manor.  The children
      are targets.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Anyone Speak Dwarven?">
      The PCs have obtained a map or book written in Khuzan and need
      to get it translated. Wybert is fluent and what he discovers
      proves very interesting. He insists on coming along.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The climb to become nobility is a long and hard one, but the
        fall from nobility is disturbingly easy. Wybert is the
        youngest of four. His father was the youngest son of six from
        a small noble clan that held just one manor. When his father's
        eldest brother became clanhead, Wybert's family was "invited"
        to leave and find subsistence elsewhere. They moved to the
        local town, where his father earned a moderate living as a
        member of the town guard. Although two of his brothers also
        became soldiers, Wybert was not the martial type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wybert's mother, junior nobility herself, taught him reading,
        writing, and arithmetic. When he was older, he attended a
        small private academy. To make extra money to pay for his
        education, he tutored younger boys. This gave him his first
        taste of teaching. He learned he had a natural gift for
        helping others learn.  Soon, he surpassed his instructor and
        was running his own school, teaching wealthy guildsmen's sons
        and the occasional member of the junior nobility.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Wybert's former students rose from the humble ranks of
        junior nobility to prominence within the kingdom. Remembering
        his old mentor, the knight retained Wybert to teach his
        children. Wybert's skill at teaching soon earned him a fine
        reputation. When the knight's children grew up, another noble
        family quickly snapped Wybert up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now a man of mature years, Wybert has had a very successful
        career. He has a nice townhouse with an excellent library. He
        is very knowledgeable about the region and much more
        approachable than the Save-K'norrian temple for those looking
        for information.

      The PCs arrive at a manor after a long day on the road. They see
      a bush hanging outside a prosperous-looking cottage, the sign
      that ale is available. There, they meet the somewhat
      curmudgeonly reeve. His ale is excellent and he has news.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="We Don't Have Time for Your Adventures.">
      The PCs have uncovered a threat to the local manor. The holder
      is old and unable to assist. His reeve, Roul, thinks assisting
      the PCs is a waste of time but the beadle wants to help. Can the
      PCs convince Roul?
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Please, Sir. Can You Help Me?">
      Roul approaches the PCs in town. He is lost. It is his first
      time in the big city and he doesn't see too well. He can't find
      his wife and daughter and is beside himself with worry. If the
      PCs help, they will earn themselves a loyal, if gruff and
      inflexible, friend and ally.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        The position of manor reeve is normally held by the villein
        with the most unfree acres. Roul easily qualifies, as he holds
        five more acres than any other villein. His family has lived
        in the same village for six generations and the position of
        reeve has passed from father to son for the last three. Roul
        began learning the job at his father's knee while only a
        toddler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roul is a skilled farmer and knows every inch of the
        manor. His knowledge extends to its residents as well.  He
        knows the hard workers, the slackers, and everyone's
        situation. Like his father and grandfather before him, Roul is
        strict and demanding, but fair. He tolerates no
        slacking. Unfortunately, he is not the most imaginative fellow
        and can be quite inflexible. Several of the other residents
        have suggested varying the crops and trying new ideas but Roul
        will have none of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roul is not in charge of the village militia. The manor lord
        is adamant that the men train regularly and has tasked the
        beadle, a yeoman several years younger than Roul, to lead the
        training. Roul and the beadle butt heads almost every Lesser
        Sapelah (Peonian lay mass); Roul wants the men to return to
        work immediately after the mass, while the beadle insists they
        spend the afternoon drilling. So far, the manor lord has sided
        with the beadle, who takes great delight in keeping the men,
        including Roul, drilling all afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all his skill and knowledge at farming, Roul is also a
        decent militia-man. He is skilled with the quarterstaff and
        club but useless with a bow. Roul has always wondered how
        others can see the target so far away.  He often squints when
        talking to people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes: Roul cannot see far enough to accurately throw his
        spear beyond short range. For longer attempts, the GM should
        randomly determine where the spear falls. He has a bow but
        never uses it.

      The PCs are invited to a dinner party and Oren is one of the
      boys serving them. The plate is too big and he ends up dumping a
      large haunch of hot beef into one PC's lap.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Brawl.">
      The PCs come across a boy in a page's tabard being set upon by
      three other pages, egged on by a vicious squire. Oren is slowly
      giving ground and looking for a way out, but his attackers have
      cornered him. He looks to the PCs for help.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Unexpected Responsibility.">
      A PC knight is a friend of Oren's master. The old knight is
      dying. He knows a conventional knight won't accept the boy, but
      thinks an adventurer knight might be more openminded.  He asks
      the PC to complete Oren's training so he can join the Lady of
      Paladins, become a common squire, and perhaps one day, a true
      knight.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        Oren's father, Jamys, was once an ataken (common squire) in
        the Laranian Order of the Lady of Paladins.  He had to leave
        his beloved fighting order to come home and take over the
        operation of the family mill.  Jamys has transferred his
        military ambitions to his son, Oren. He dreams Oren will rise
        above his station and become a knight. Oren's future is
        anything but certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Oren was a toddler, Jamys has been preparing him. He
        carved him a wooden sword and shield and had a leatherworker
        make him a miniature helmet. He trained Oren to ride a horse
        and to spar and constantly challenged him to be better,
        faster, and smarter than his peers. Oren's mother has taught
        him to read and write and do his figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jamys made a deal with his former master, a retired
        knight-commander of the Lady of Paladins, to foster Oren as
        his page. Ataken are handpicked from among the meken (common
        soldiers) of the order. They are selected for their skill with
        horses and skill at arms.  Jamys hopes that fostering Oren
        with a skilled knight will give the boy the edge he needs to
        succeed in his future career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his father's best intentions, Oren is finding the path
        that has been thrust upon him to be very difficult.  Although
        he has the natural talent and drive, he is still a
        commoner. His master treats him fairly, but the squires and
        pages of other knights torment him mercilessly, calling him a
        mud-born commoner who is trying to rise above his
        station. Oren frequently ends up in fights with the other
        boys. The fact that he wins more than he loses has not won him
        many friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes: Oren has not yet reached his full strength; add +1 STR
        every two years until he reaches age 21 (Str 16). His height,
        weight and frame will change as well.

      The PCs have offended the Navehan church. They defeat the first
      assassin, a young Dranatha attempting his first kill of an
      outsider. For a month after, there is no sign of further
      pursuit. Then, a harper befriends them at an inn.

      A powerful noble is dead. The physicians say it was
      murder. Someone has assassinated the noble. The PCs are brought
      in to hunt down the killer. One of the maids thought she saw the

    <note type="hook" value="We Need Him Dead.">
      Someone has thoroughly angered the PCs. They can't touch him
      directly so someone suggests hiring an assassin. Contacts in the
      underworld put them in contact with Albin. He succeeds, but then
      begins to blackmail the PCs. It becomes clear, either it is him
      or them.
    </note>
    <note type="background">
      <p>
        No one knows Albin's real name, not even him. He was kidnapped
        at age 11 months and raised by the members of a Navehan
        temple. While in the temple, he was simply called Longhals,
        which means "longneck."  The real Albin of Rihale was a harper
        who bore an uncanny resemblance to Longhals. The Navehan
        learned to play the same musical instruments as Albin and
        shadowed him for a year before killing him and assuming his
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Longhals is now a Dranatha (deacon) and a Navas-Kara (temple
        assassin). He passed his ritual of passage eight years ago,
        killing his opponent - an acolyte he had shared a room with
        for ten years - without hesitation or remorse. Three years
        ago, after a dispute with the Arasha (chief deacon) over a
        mission he felt should have been his, Longhals was subject to
        the Herth-Akan (punishment ritual). He was given an hour head
        start and had to evade the murderous pursuit of seven temple
        brothers for three days and nights. Not only did he succeed,
        he also managed to kill four of his pursuers plus the inferior
        assassin and intended victim that were the subject of the
        dispute. The three surviving pursuers committed
        suicide. Longhals and the Arasha are now mortal enemies;
        eventually they will fight to the death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Longhals travels far and wide in his persona as the
        mild-mannered, happy-go-lucky harper, Albin. He is a decent
        singer, plays a very passable harp, and knows many excellent
        stories. Several of his patrons have mysteriously died a few
        days after his departure. However, there is never anything to
        connect him to the deaths.  His skill with poison ensures a
        certain kill.

      Deep in the forest, far from civilization, the PCs come across a

      locked in mortal combat inside a dome-shaped magical shield. The
      PCs watch as the momentum shifts back and forth until finally
      one mage is destroyed with a nightmarish blast.  The dome melts
      away and they see Kirill lying on the ground. He looks straight
      at them and calls feebly for help. There is no one for
      miles. What do they do? What will he do when he wakes up and
      realizes they have seen the duel?

      Kirill has been watching the PCs closely, testing them with
      difficult missions. The king of Evael (or Azadmere) asks Kirill
      to recommend a group he can trust to complete a sensitive

        his parents as mentors. He has traveled extensively from a
        young age, never staying in one spot for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kirill selected Jmorvi as his primary convocation, mainly
        because he was very fond of the fine chantry in Glenoth, where
        he has spent several years as a teen. He also chose it because
        it was not one of his parent's primary convocations and he
        knew they could help him attune to the other convocations
        later on. He completed his apprenticeship (Mavari) in just
        five years and set out to explore the world as a journeyman
        (Satia-Mavari). He was made a master (Shenava) when he
        returned just two short years later, a sign that he was
        destined for great things. He quickly expanded his skills
        outside his primary convocation. Fyvria and Peleahn were
        swiftly followed by Odivshe and Lyahvi, and then finally
        Savorya.
      </p>
      <p>
        He recently transcended, becoming a gray mage, and is now one
        of the most powerful Shek-Pvar on Hârn. It would take a truly
        exceptional student to pique his interest. Instead, he roams
        here and there in the guise of a sage. Many seek his counsel,
        but he is sparing with his advice, preferring to watch and
        take wellchosen, but subtle, action. He is a confidant of the
        kings of Evael and Azadmere and keeps them informed of events
        across Hârn. He is one of the few humans with free and
        unfettered access to both their kingdoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes: Kirill's tunic is enchanted and stiffens like plate
        when struck with force. His staff is a gray focus, giving him
        +10 to all convocations.
      </p>
      <p class="Acknowledgement">
        To my good friend, Thomas Shook, Hârncon supporter and mapper
        extraordinaire, who bears a distinct similarity to this NPC in
        his ability to magically transform half-baked ideas into
        brilliant maps.

        <em>Lord of Goffin Manor</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Edric Quarne, Goffin's current fief holder and the head of
        Clan Quarne, is a politically naive, weak-willed, prideful
        but caring lord known for his easy charm. Born at Goffin
        in 688, Edric was the eldest of five children of Sir Edren
        Quarne and his wife Lady Eleia. Edric grew up attending
        every Royal Chelebin Tournament. While still a boy, he
        became enamoured with jousting, which caused him to beg
        his parents to attend any contests that occurred in
        Northern Kaldor and to try to visit Tashal for the Winter
        Tournament. Edric later squired for Sir Morek Lasvarn, the
        lord of nearby Medarsin Manor, and was knighted by him in
        709 during Edric's twenty-first year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 710, although never more than a knight of mediocre
        skill, Sir Edric's early fervour for jousting did net him
        a place as one of the four semi-final combatants of the
        Olokand joust. However, Sir Edric's luck has been steadily
        declining since that time. Combined with the small fortune
        in lost wagers, mounts, arms and amour, and adding in
        poorly healed wounds brought on by past tourneys; this
        heralds an end to his jousting career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edric's pride was sorely wounded at last year's Royal
        Tournament of Chivalry, when he made his worst showing yet
        and was violently unhorsed on his first pass. This fall
        has caused infrequent bouts of dizziness. Further injury
        occurred when his liege lord's eldest son, Mirald Harabor,
        arrogantly slandered his wife Denerelle and her sister,
        Keriela. While occasionally Edric can be oblivious to the
        risks involved, for now he has remained quiet about the
        insult so as to not prejudice Sir Maldan against
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faced with the end of his jousting days, Sir Edric is
        contemplating the lost time and money spent. He has just
        begun to worry about the management of his fief and has
        concerns about the fairness of his father's will. Edric's
        unsophisticated thoughtfulness for his fief's tenants is
        rare in a lord. He is generous to the villagers and truly
        cares about their well-being. While still unfree, the
        serfs in Goffin are some of the best fed and treated
        peasants in the area. Sir Edric oftentimes can be seen
        amongst the villager's cottages and occasionally will
        invite a few of his serfs to dine with him in the manor
        house.

        Visitors to the Chantry will rarely get beyond the guard
        room on the second floor. There, they will be forced to wait
        to see the Seneschal, Gerlen of Uvela. He deals with the
        outside world on behalf of the Chantry and the Viran. Finely
        dressed, well groomed and obviously very well educated, he
        is not intimidated by nobles, guildsmen or other Shek
        P'var. The son of an accomplished Jmorvi master, he has been
        around magic all his whole life. He also grew up mixing with
        rich and powerful members of the Melderyni nobility, so they
        hold little awe for him. When he speaks, he does so with the
        full backing of the Chantry members and, if necessary, the
        Baron. He is polite, but immoveable when he wants to be. The
        guards obey him without question.

        The gang's leader, Raet was a yeoman who supplemented his
        income poaching and relieving travellers of their portable
        wealth. Despite being a former farmer, he has no compunction
        about stealing from the poor and keeping it for himself, but
        what he truly loves is stealing from the rich and
        humiliating them while he does it. He has the skill and
        ability to do anything he chooses, but he is naturally lazy
        and prefers to live off the hard work of others. He is
        tough, fast and the undisputed leader of the band. In the
        last eighteen months, he has killed three members of the
        gang who challenged his leadership.

        Ryal of Breneh is a bastard, the half-brother of Daquer of
        Iyesin ("Scarlet Dak"), a well-known Peran trader. Like his
        brother, Ryal had a Kuboran mother. His father met her
        during one of his many trading expeditions to Kustan. His
        Kobean mother and grandparents raised him until he was
        sixteen, when his father agreed to take him to
        Golotha. Daquer was surprised to find that he had a
        halfbrother, but the two get along well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their father's influence was strong. Both men are short,
        heavy-set, with a strong nose and a fast receding
        hairline. Ryal has bad teeth, a result of his love of
        sweets. He is quick-witted, friendly and seemingly eager to
        please. However, more than one customer has walked out of a
        negotiation thinking they got a great bargain, only to
        discover he talked them down to a fraction of what their
        goods were worth. Few people can stay mad at him for long,
        however, because he soon has them back at the negotiation
        table to "make it up to them" with an "even better"
        deal. Buyers beware, indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
        When their father died, Daquer inherited the franchise. With
        the help of Ryal, he established a small trading post on the
        Kobean - Obodu border. Ryal was the natural choice to run
        it, as he is the only person Daquer trusts with such a
        delicate task. Ryal's family ties to the Kobean have greatly
        eased the difficult task of establishing the outpost. His
        half-Rethemi blood and political marriage to the daughter of
        the war-chief of a nearby tribe have ingratiated him with
        the Obodu. His father-inlaw is a frequent visitor to the
        post and enjoys preferential trading privileges. He and his
        wife have three children, two boys and a girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last couple of years, Ryal has proven himself to be
        a jack-of-all-trades: diplomat, mercantyler, carpenter and
        soldier. Almost single-handedly, he has build the trading
        post from nothing into a thriving business delicately
        balanced between competing tribes. He is actively assisting
        Daquer in the negotiations to build a second trading post
        close to Kustan.

        <em>Bailiff of Ravin Hundred and Head of Clan Polyle</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second son of Sir Gilryn and the Lady Meriela, Sabir was
        born in 674 at Zinkur Manor in Yedarn Hundred near
        Quivum. When he was thirteen, Sir Bran, his Clanhead, was
        made Bailiff of the Hundred and his family moved to Ravin
        Manor. Three years later he was sent to college at Erone
        Abbey where he spent four years under the tutelage of the
        priests of Larani. Although he liked to spend his spare time
        with the melana of the temple guard, he also learned law,
        religion, politics, public speaking and to read and
        write. He honed his skills as an accomplished rider, making
        the fifteen league journey from the abbey to Ravin several
        times a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he was knighted in 694TR, Ezar's War had been raging
        for twelve years. Outraged by the assassination of Queen
        Eriel and too young to know better, he joined the great
        feudal host mustering in Dyrisa. Although enthusiastic, fit
        and with a budding reputation as a jouster, he was too young
        and inexperienced to be selected to join Sir Grolis'
        army. Instead he marched north under the command of the
        Earls of Heroth and Sarkum. As the greatest campaign in
        Kandian history unfolded just a few leagues away, he spent
        the year patrolling the Thardic border.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the war ended, his father encouraged him to see the
        world and satisfy his wanderlust. For five years he
        travelled the kingdom, developing a reputation as a both a
        wicked jouster and a clever jester. His skill with a lance
        was matched with a razor sharp wit and a wicked sense of
        humour. His deep booming laugh and easy going manner made
        him popular with the other knights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sabir was just twenty-six when Sir Bran died. He rushed home
        to attend the Succession Council. His support and oratory
        skills were vital to his father's campaign to be elected
        as Clanhead. Expecting his older brother to inherit, he
        sought his fortune in Queen Mirelael's service and spent
        four years in the Royal Guard. When his father's health
        began to deteriorate, he was called home. Discovering his
        elder brother had become an alcoholic, he took over the
        running of the manor, forcing him to learn a great deal
        about farming in a hurry. On this father's death in 710TR,
        he was the obvious choice to replace him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forty-six, Sir Sabir is an avid rider and exercises
        daily. He is athletic, well-muscled and mature looking. He
        has deep brown eyes, ash brown hair and a flowing beard. He
        always dresses formally, in clothes of the highest quality,
        as befits his station. He is very affectionate, especially
        with his granddaughter, but can be very aggressive and
        direct with outsiders. He tends to pace back and forth when
        he talks and has a passion for riding, breeding and raising
        horses.

        Noble by birth, with some noble skills (such as literacy),
        he is the son of a litigator who was trained by a
        gladiator. He is slim and looks somewhat younger than his
        twenty-one years. He has brown eyes and cinnamon hair. He
        comes across as somewhat emotionless, but this hides a
        streak of cruelty. In Coranan he is a frequent visitor and
        enthusiastic supporter of the Pamesani games. He sweats
        profusely, especially when lying. He is trying very hard
        to play the role of Sir "Ordidis" but he lacks practical
        knowledge, such as where the entrance to the cellar is.

        The son of a litigator, Vurnt has spent most of his life
        in court. He is an acceptable litigant, but not
        brilliant. He thought he struck gold when he was
        approached by Lady Lymria Rynn to represent her in
        Kanday. He spent years working on her case in return for a
        share of the profits. When she ran out of money, she
        offered him the only thing she had left, her body. She
        agreed to marry him in return for his continuing
        representation. Vurnt is a plump man, older man with green
        eyes and brown hair. He is hard-headed and loves to play
        games with people.

        Born in the slums of Coranan, Querth found service with
        Vurnt of Masane because he would work cheaper than anyone
        else. Although poorly paid, he is well fed and has a
        strong athletic build. Nineteen years old, Querth has sort
        of an indeterminate quality. If he doesn't open his mouth,
        he could be thought older, but he sometimes shows
        immaturity in his actions. He has brown eyes and black
        hair. He always seems a bit shady and makes obscure jokes
        with nonsense punch lines. Uril (Sir "Ordidis") often
        cuffs him upside the head when he becomes annoying.

      <p>
        Born into the powerful Bisidril Clan, Zaurial grew up in a
        strict Agrikan household. Strength, discipline and
        fearlessness were emphasized. He received little love from
        his mother and frequent beatings from his father. Nurturing
        his rejection and hate, he trained relentlessly, driving
        himself to the edge of endurance. By the time he was
        twenty-one, he had emerged as one of the best fighters on
        HÃ¢rn. Since, his victories in tournaments, combat, feuds
        and duels have honed his deadly art.
      </p>
      <p>
        His uncle, Klyrdes Bisidril, is clan head. Childless, he has
        selected Miriam, Zaurial's elder sister, as heir to their
        family's wealth and influence. He also appointed her steward
        of the family estates during his frequent absences. Perhaps
        surprisingly for an Agrikan, Zaurial thinks his sister is a
        better governor and heir than himself. It was his mother who
        ensured the clan prospered, as his father was unpopular with
        his uncle and a poor administrator. Like their mother,
        Miriam is a hard, cruel taskmistress, squeezing the peasants
        ruthlessly. Considered evil personified, Miriam is greatly
        feared by many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Freed from the burdens of administrating the clan estates
        and able to draw on the substantial family treasury as
        required, Zaurial lives only for war, killing and
        Agrik. Loved by his men, hated by his enemies, he has little
        sympathy for the weak. He believes the best thing in life is
        to crush your enemies, drive them before you and hear the
        lamentation of the women. He hates women, preferring to rape
        and torture them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A skilled warrior and master swordsman, he is a man of
        honour to those he respects. Zaurial has a stern gaze, is
        not ease to impress and can smell strength in a man. He
        wears a full suit of chain mail with a giant fur cloak and
        carries a silver broadsword. A gold medallion around his
        neck openly declares he is a lay brother of the Warriors of
        Mamaka, placing him above the law. Despite the fact the
        Bisidril Clan have more enemies than friends, he proudly
        displays the sable field and three gold lions on his shield
        and surcoat. A wealthy young noble man, he insists his
        residences be kept clean and patronizes the Bridgetower Inn
        for its fine wines and cultured company.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Broadsword(*) is magical: "Agrik's Fury" is a heavy
        weapon requiring Str 16+ to wield; it's silver finish does
        not rust or tarnish; it burns with red flame when fighting
        Laranians, +2 fire damage to every successful hit; as
        Executioner's weapon forces amputation roll at +5 on a K4 or
        K5 strike to the neck.

      <p>
        The son of Zaurial's youngest aunt, Jonzter life has been
        abnormal from conception. His mother was a fanatic Agrikan
        priestess. Determined that her child would be great, she
        arranged to conceive him during a special ceremony. In
        698TR, during the Ukhila (Octennial Games) at the Feast of
        Balefire (8 Agrazhar), she was tied to an altar and
        impregnated by eight high priests in a ceremonial orgy in
        front of the entire congregation. Unfortunately for her, the
        plan did not take into account Klyrdes' (her own brother)
        fanaticism. Eight months and eight days later, late in her
        pregnancy, she was seized and brought back to the temple. On
        the very same altar, while she pleaded for her life, Klyrdes
        cut open her womb and pulled Jonzter from her. He was bathed
        in his mother's blood, as she burned alive as a sacrifice to
        Agrik.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jonzter was raised to be a priest of Agrik from birth. His
        noble lineage, family wealth and power meant he was denied
        nothing. A series of guardians protected him through his
        childhood, though many met bizarre and unexplainable
        deaths. Their indulgence resulted in a depraved, violent and
        vengeful child, emotionally scarred and psychotic. The last
        and most influential of these protectors was an Ulankh (free
        priest) of the Clerical Order of the Fuming Gate. He began
        teaching Jonzter invocations at an extremely young age,
        twelve. Jonzter's rapid progress and extraordinary skills
        convinced the cleric that he was a direct emissary of Agrik
        himself. The priest told Jonzter this, feeding his
        delusions. This idea has resulted in Jonzter suffering
        frequent hallucinations and recurring nightmares.
      </p>
      <p>
        At sixteen he joined the Order of the Fuming Gate (his
        mother's order), in large part to spite his uncle (Primate
        and member of the Order of Mamaka). Already a highly
        trained, he proceeded quickly through the rank of Agnichari
        (Acolyte) to Heruchai (Lieutenant) of the Aperagris (Master
        of High Discipline). He claimed to have received visions
        directly from Agrik and began to make prophetic
        statements. Many of the other priests and acolytes began to
        defer to him, threatening the status of the Viriahn (High
        Priest) and his ally the Senesharil (Grandmaster). They
        declared him insane and had him cast out. Only the secret
        intervention of his uncle, Klyrdes saved him from being
        killed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that time, he has been living with Zaurial, the only
        member of his clan who will have him. Crazed, given to weird
        rants and prophecies, he is seriously psychotic with an
        insatiable blood lust. Only Zaurial's iron grip and frequent
        beatings have kept him (barely) in line. Klyrdes keeps close
        tabs on him through Zaurial, just in case he actually is an
        emissary of the Immortal Warlord of Balgashang.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of his mental disorders Jonzter suffers frequent visual and
        auditory hallucinations and regular nightmares.

        Five knights are sworn to Zaurial's service. He likes to
        refer to them as the "degenerate but deadly." Their scarred
        bodies and cold, self-confident aura speaks volumes. The
        knights share the private hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sir Gerrin Staenbridge</em> is stylish and handsome, a man
        of wit and learning and a professional killer. He has a
        manor and has an arranged marriage with a wife and two
        children. Quietly homosexual, he rarely visits his family,
        preferring the thrill and excitement of life in Zaurial's
        retinue. Hard riding, fighting and the company of men give
        purpose to his life. An outstanding swordsman and duellist,
        he is second in command of the Sworn Band when Zaurial is
        absent. His preferred weapon is the bastard sword (ML
        108).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sir Buell Golka</em> has travelled widely. Known as the
        "grey man", he has the ability to blend into any crowd. He
        has used this ability to great effect spying for Zaurial. He
        has visited Kanday and Tharda numerous times. He carries a
        fine broadsword, the heirloom of a prominent, now dead,
        Thardic nobleman. Sir Buell is an excellent lancer (ML 98),
        second only to Zaurial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born to a Laranian family, <em>Sir Derue</em> was banished
        from Kanday for a series of brutal rapes and murders. In
        Coranan, he converted to Agrikanism and fell in with a group
        of mercenaries heading for Golotha. There, he met Zaurial
        and the two became fast friends. One night, in a drunken
        confession, Sir Derue revealed his real name and history to
        his master. Zaurial now uses the information to control and
        manipulate him. He is an fine rider (ML 100).
      </p>
      <p>
        A bit of a dandy and a devil with the ladies, <em>Sir Hadden
          Pineo</em> joined the company for the adventure and the
        glory. Politically naive, he rarely considers the
        consequences of his actions and lives for the
        moment. Blindly loyal to Zaurial, he will follow him
        wherever he leads, even unto death. Subtly has never been
        his trademark and his weapons of choice are a massive black
        mace (WQ +2, +3 to blunt dmg) and a blood red
        shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        An impressionable young man and an ardent Agrikan, <em>Sir
          Brak Araku</em> is the youngest son of a very minor branch of
        the royal family. Brak's father felt his son needed real
        combat experience; the primate suggested service with
        Zaurial's household. Now twenty-three, the right side of his
        face is covered with lines of scar tissue he wears like a
        badge of honour. Utterly devoted to his new master, he would
        kill his own mother if ordered to. His family ties make
        intrigue as natural as breathing (ML 82).

    <note name="background">
      <p>
        People knew Mya was special from the day she was born. An only
        child, her mother died in childbirth; her father is a cousin
        and household knight to Sir Gerd Risalsin, Baron of Thiri in
        Rethem. Frequently away on missions for his liege, her father
        left her to be raised by her wet nurse. Despite this, Mya
        flourished. She sang regularly for the Baron, quickly becoming
        his favourite.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 16, Mya attended the Slaughterfest ceremonies in
        Golotha with the Baron's household. Her unearthly sounding
        voice soared above everyone else's. It captured the attention
        of the Aperagris (Master of the High Discipline), of the Order
        of the Octagonal Pit. He approached the Baron, complimented
        her on her singing and "asked" him if she could become one of
        his acolytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mya had always been different than other children. She acted
        older and wiser than her years; leading people to shy away
        from her and whisper she had an "old and powerful soul." She
        also had the uncanny and frightening ability to know what
        people were thinking or going to do before they knew
        themselves. After sensing the fear it created in others, Mya
        was quick to disguise her abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the arena, she sensed that if the Baron refused the
        Aperagris' "request," he would be killed and she would be
        forced to join the order anyway. Before the Baron could
        refuse, she begged him to "allow her this great
        honour."
      </p>
      <p>
        Although not the strongest or smartest acolyte, Mya has
        thrived in the Order. Over the last nine years, she has risen
        quickly to the rank of Aperagrisherucha (Heruchai (Lieutenant)
        to the Master of the High Discipline). She has miraculously
        survived no less than eleven assassination attempts, all by
        ambushing and killing her attackers, usually with her
        dagger. They say when she looks at people she sees into their
        souls. Secretly, even her master is afraid of her. Mya knows
        it and revels in her power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although based in Golotha, Mya travels frequently for the
        Aperagris and often visits Coranan and Shiran. She has also
        participated in several hunts for special creatures destined
        for the Pamesani Arena.

      The PCs are travelling in Rethem or Tharda
      undercover. They walk past an Agrikan priestess and her
      escort. Suddenly, she spins around and yells, "Seize them!" She
      interrogates and tortures them, but seems to know the answers before
      they give them.

      The Octagonal Pit wants a particular type of

      <p>
        Growing up among the urban poor, Balis always kept to himself, never
        caused trouble, and started working as a day labourer as soon as he
        was old enough. He committed his first murder when he was sixteen. He
        still dreams of the look on the face of the young girl as he choked
        the life out of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four years and four murders later, Balis started working as a
        teamster hauling goods throughout the region. This allowed him
        to spread his depredations around, but he still limited
        himself to one victim a year. Balis was always very careful,
        selecting his victims well in advance, studying them and only
        moving in for the kill when the time was right. The elderly,
        the poor and those who would not be missed were his main
        victims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight years ago, in the spring of 712, things changed
        dramatically.  Balis was attacked by a group of bandits that
        beat him severely and left him for dead. When he was found he
        was taken to a Peonian abbey where they nursed him back to
        health. The beating left him with a number of scars and blind
        in his right eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his recovery he had an epiphany and when he left, he
        was wearing the robes of a Peonian Esolani (acolyte). Balis
        started wandering from village to village, living off the
        charity and goodwill of others. In return he helps with farm
        labour, chops wood, helps with livestock or whatever else
        needs to be done. Except for the winter months, he never stays
        in one place for more than a few days. If anyone asks, he
        tells them that he is living the life Peoni has chosen for
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 718, he killed again for the first time since the
        attack. Three more murders have occurred since. Balis believes
        that Peoni has given him a mission to help those that are most
        deserving. He looks for the most pious, poorest, lay member of
        a village and "sends them to the Meadows of Valon", the
        Peonian heaven. He places a knot in his robe belt for every
        person he has sent to Peoni
      </p>

    <note name="background">
      <p>
        Cleric of the Order of the Rydequelyn, an inquisitor of the
        Save K'norrian Church, Rodolk is tasked with monitoring the
        location, strength and influence of the dark churches: Agrik,
        Naveh and Morgath. He travels the island in the guise of a
        storyteller. His horrific morality tales and frightening ghost
        stories, combined with a hypnotic and entrancing ability to
        weave story and act out a tale, draw large crowds despite (or
        perhaps because of) his sometimes-grim appearance. He dresses
        all in black; his tunic is embroidered with tales from his
        stories. Rodolk is well known around the campfires and in the
        inns of the caravans and market towns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cleric's purpose is not to tell stories; it is to gauge
        the reaction of the local population. When he recounts a tale
        of Agrik, do any of the peasants become uncomfortable? When he
        chronicles the work of a priest of Naveh, does a guildsman
        begin to fidget nervously? When he describes the torment that
        awaits the followers of Morgath, does a noble slip away? These
        are the telltale signs he is looking for.  After his stories
        finished, these are the people he subtly investigates. He
        misses little.
      </p>
      <p>
        The son of a longshoreman, Rodolk is far from his humble
        beginnings. A brilliant mind and iron-will won him entry into
        the church when many believed his disquieting looks and deep
        voice would preclude it. His animal magnetism and ability to
        sniff out dark religions got him transferred to the Rydequelyn
        when others were only finishing their first Labour of
        Reverence. His talent for storytelling and eidetic memory
        carried him quickly up the ranks when many believed he should
        be hidden in the back room. Rodolk has surprised everyone,
        except himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered a leading authority in the dark religions, Rodolk
        has memorised most of what the Save K'norrian church knows
        about them, including a basic ability in the temple tongues of
        Agrik and Morgath. He can easily pass as an acolyte or Lay
        Grandmaster of any of the three churches and has occasionally
        used this knowledge to infiltrate their ranks and gather
        intelligence.
      </p>

      Rodolk has uncovered an Agrikan cell in the town. He wants to

    <note type="hook" value="Unwelcome Notice.">
      A local Navehan fears Rodolk is on to him. He concocts a story

      The local lord has penetrated Rodolk's disguise. He has little

      something.

      <p>
        Marlyn grew up as the daughter of a small town innkeeper. She
        could have inherited and spent a comfortable life if her
        corruptible nature had not gotten in the way. When she was
        thirteen, her father caught her pilfering items from some of
        the guests. It was not the first time, only the first time she
        was caught. After recovering from the beating he gave her,
        Marlyn ran away from home, as far as she knows, her family
        never came looking for her.
      </p>
      <p>
        After fleeing to Tashal, Marlyn fell on hard times and into
        bad company, turning to prostitution and petty crime in order
        to keep herself fed. Unfortunately her activities brought her
        to the attention of the Lia-Kavair who forced her into working
        at one of their lower class brothels. A few years later, a
        mercenary captain purchased her from the Lia-Kavair, keeping
        her as his personal servant and cook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four years ago, in 716, the mercenary captain, along with most
        of his men were killed during a raid on the caravan they were
        guarding.  Marlyn was able to escape with a little money and
        not much else. Since that time, she has found work as a
        barmaid in a fairly respectable tavern, supplementing her
        income with prostitution. What the tavern keeper does not know
        is that Marlyn is up to her old tricks, pilfering a bit from
        both her clients, and the tavern itself.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="My Precious is Missing.">
      A wealthy merchant, noble, or religious figure spent the night
      with Marlyn, and they have discovered that a small but valuable
      item is missing. The PCs are brought in to quietly recover the
      item. The job may require Marlyn's permanent silence.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Long Lost Relative.">
      One of the PCs is distantly related to Marlyn and recognizes her
      from her distinctive birthmark. They know that Marlyn's father
      still hopes for her to return home someday.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Does he talk in his sleep?">
      The PCs discover that someone they need information from is a
      client of Marlyn's. The PCs can either approach her to get
      information for them, or conduct a raid during one of their
      trysts.

    <note type="hook" value="The Serial Killer.">
      Someone has been killing the ladies of the night one by
      one. Marlyn was the latest victim, but managed to survive,
      potentially even wounding her attacker. PCs been tasked with
      putting a stop to the killings, can Marlyn give them the clues
      they need to solve the mystery? Will the killer try to finish
      the job?

      <p>
        Hjotra, her husband Knut, his second wife Erska, and their
        children immigrated from Froyaheim, Menglana to Geldeheim,
        Orbaal in 713TR.  Knut, a furrier and hideworker set up a
        successful business, making contacts with the Ymodi as a
        source of supply. In 715TR he was able to marry a local half
        Ivinian, half Jarin woman, Marja, giving him the requisite
        three wives to sit on the Thrangaad.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an Agrikan priestess tried to recruit Knut's eldest
        daughter, Hrefna, into the Crimson Dancers, Knut, a devout
        Sarajinian, confronted the priestess and told her to stay away
        from his children.  The next day Knut disappeared, his
        mutilated body was found floating in the fjord two days
        later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hjotra went before the Pendragon, stating her case that the
        Agrikans should be required to pay wergild, and that the
        Pendragon should enforce the Ljarl. The Pendragon refused, and
        none of the remaining Thrangaad members would go against
        him. After this, the Agrikans started a campaign of
        harassment, culminating in the murder of Erska in the
        market. Seeing no other option, Hjotra and Marja gathered what
        they and the children could carry (including Knut's arms and
        armor) and fled. Knut's Ymodi contacts helped them reach
        safety, away from Geldeheim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Marja and the six children are safe, Hjotra has begun
        planning her blood vengeance against the Agrikans. As most
        Ivinian women, Hjotra has been trained in the use of arms. She
        has been training with armor, sword and shield and intends to
        actively participate in the destruction of the Agrikans at
        Geldeheim, but realizes that she cannot do it alone.
      </p>

    <note type="hook" value="Recruits.">
      Hjotra sent word back to Froyaheim about what happened. PCs are

      <p>
        Barton of Gelram can be described in one word – Lazy. He never
        wanted to be an innkeeper, but then he never wanted to be much
        of anything. It is only by luck, or perhaps a desire to get
        rid of him, that his master signed his papers making him a
        journeyman of the trade.  Since then, Barton has moved from
        Inn to Inn looking for easy money, never staying long enough
        to be kicked out or receive an official guild reprimand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quality of inns Barton has been able to gain employment
        with has steadily gone down as word of his work ethic, or lack
        thereof has gotten around. He recently started at an inn that
        is little better than a flophouse – which suits him just
        fine. In fact, the Master Innkeeper is actually the head of
        the local Lia-Kavair. He leaves most of the day-to-day
        operation of the inn to Barton. Barton does just enough to
        keep the place open, and otherwise spends his time drinking,
        gambling, and spending time with the prostitutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being kept away from the operations of the Lia-Kavair,
        Barton is a good observer and while lazy, he is not stupid. If
        the innkeeper knew just how much Barton had figured out about
        his illicit operations, Barton would be in for a bad time. As
        it is, Barton is keeping his true level of knowledge secret,
        waiting until a good opportunity presents itself.

      Desperate for a place to stay, PCs are forced to take a room at

      PCs are trying to get information on the operations of the

      threatened his life for the information.

      <p>
        Fisk was born in the Evanekin region of Chelemby to a wealthy
        family.  He spent his early years serving on family owned
        ships conducting trade throughout the region. As with many
        Ivinian clans, trade was occasionally supplemented with Viking
        raids or piracy. When not at sea, he spent much of his time
        studying at the temple of Sarajin. Fisk is a skilled warrior,
        but would rather talk his foes into surrender rather than
        fight. He only draws a weapon when all else has failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A devout follower of Sarajin, Fisk has travelled to many of
        the holy sites throughout Ivinia. During his travels, he has
        earned a reputation as an expert on the finer points of the
        Ljarl, often illustrating these points with stories from
        Sarajinian mythology. The great clans of Chelemby have found
        Fisk to be a valuable resource, and a skilled mediator often
        called in to help settle disputes that might otherwise have
        lead to bloodshed between the clans.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the dispute is settled, the clans involved provide Fisk
        with gifts to recompense him for his time, the value of the
        gift typically is a measure of how happy a particular clan is
        with the agreement.  Fisk is wealthier than he appears.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his pleasant voice, good looks and reputation, Fisk has
        not had a shortage of marriage proposals. His continued
        refusal of these offers has started some gossipmongers to
        insinuate things best left unsaid. Fisk has told his clan head
        that only after he has visited Kyriheim will he begin to
        consider getting married. He has not made any mention of when
        he intends to make the pilgrimage to Kyriheim.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Vision.">
      Fisk made his trip to Kyriheim where he received a vision, and
      was given a prophecy by the Oracle. Fisk believes that the PCs
      are somehow part of the prophecy.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Mediator.">
      The PCs are associated with a clan in the midst of a
      dispute. Rather than let things turn into a blood feud, the PCs
      have been sent to bring Fisk in to negotiate a
      settlement.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Voyage.">
      Fisk is taking his own longboat to Kyriheim, and is hiring crew
      for the voyage. Opportunities for trade and other activities may
      arise.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Runestone.">
      During the course of their adventures, the PCs have discovered
      an ancient runestone. They are having trouble translating it,
      and Fisk is recommended for the job. His reaction to what the
      stone says may not be what the PCs expect.

      <p>
        Captain Elros of Merin was born in Cheryfal, the only child of
        an Odivshe Viran and the pilot-captain of the dak <em>Wave
        Dancer</em>.  His parents never married, but retain an
        amicable relationship. Elros spent his early years with his
        mother, learning the principles of Odivshe.  Later, he showed
        interest in learning the sea trade and apprenticed with his
        father as a pilot, while still continuing his magical
        studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time came for his Satia-Mavari journey, he hired on
        with a Melderyni ship travelling to Lythia. Two years later he
        returned to Cheryfal where he was granted the status of
        Sheneva. Combining his earnings as a pilot, gifts from his
        parents, and loans from the chantry, Elros was able to
        purchase a ream, making him one of the youngest captains in
        the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Captain Elros uses his ship, the <em>Storm Rider</em>, for
        regular runs throughout the Melderyni Islands, Thay, Berema in
        Emelrene, and sometimes as far West as Aleath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Predominately from Melderyn, the crew are well aware of the
        wizardly nature of their captain and recognize that some of
        the passengers and cargos are not quite what they appear to
        be. The majority of the crew have been with the ship since its
        first voyage, the ship and its crew have a reputation as being
        a bit "odd" and standoffish among the other seaman in the
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elros is considering the acquisition of a second ship to make
        a regular run between Cherafir and Chelemby. His father plans
        to retire soon, so the <em>Wave Dancer</em> may become
        available for this task.  If he can acquire the funds Elros
        would someday like to have a karune.

      <p>
        Gavin of Wem has been working caravans for over 30 years the
        last 15 as a caravan master. He has travelled all of the major
        caravan routes of HÃ¢rn, but predominately works the Salt
        Route. The son of a professional caravan guard, and a native
        of Kaldor, Gavin started his own career as a caravan guard,
        but worked his way into the operation of the caravan
        itself. Apprenticing with a master mercantyler and caravan
        master, Gavin eventually became a caravan master in his own
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        A member of the Mercantyler's guild, other mercantylers pay
        him to make sure the goods reach proper destination. He
        organizes the caravan, accepts or rejects participants to the
        caravan, interviews and hires guards, makes sure of the
        supplies, and otherwise takes care of all the details
        necessary to make the caravan run smoothly. Much like a ships
        captain, while on the trail, his word is law. Anyone causing a
        disruption is likely to find themselves left on the trail with
        all their goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gavin maintains houses, wives, and children in both Coranan
        and Tashal. The two women do not know of each other, though
        both of them suspect. Gavin plans on retiring within the next
        few years, but his marital status complicates things. Gavin
        loves both his wives, and would like to have all nine of his
        children together, but is unsure how the women would
        react.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation at Trobridge Inn, and Kurson Ondalis's growing influence
        over the region has caused Gavin some trouble over the past couple of
        years. Gavin personally detests Kurson and believes that something
        should have been done about him a long time ago.
      </p>

      The PCs need to get from Tharda to Kaldor. Though slow, the
      caravan is the safest way to travel. Fees depend on how much
      work the PCs are willing to do on the caravan trail.

      Gavin is looking for additional caravan guards this year and is

      <p>
        There are lots of timberwrights working in the forests
        throughout HÃ¢rn; most provide trees to be used for common
        goods, building materials and charcoal. Gordy is more of a
        specialist and prides himself on being able to find just the
        right piece of wood for what is needed. Many of his customers
        are weaponcrafters, lances and spears require long straight
        hardwoods, while axes, maces, bows all have unique
        requirements. Woodcarvers and artisans are also frequent
        customers. Gordy understands the particular needs of these
        crafts, and always has, or can find, the perfect wood for the
        job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordy can be seen wandering the woods with his timber-axe in
        hand, studying trees, occasionally taking branches, or marking
        a tree for future harvest. When harvesting trees, he often
        hires a group of labourers and mules to assist with getting
        the tree back to the shop he shares with his father. His
        father is semi-retired and Gordy is considering finding an
        apprentice to train. He would like to marry but is shy around
        women, and believes that his scars will drive any prospects
        away, so he avoids the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is known to the nobility and often negotiates the rights to
        harvest a single tree from a particular manor or forest
        hundred. The forests of HÃ¢rn are home to both barbarians, and
        bandits, hazards that Gordy has learned to avoid. Though
        frequently asked, he never admits to having seen anything out
        of the ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordy is seldom without work, and harvests trees year
        round. His father maintains a curing shed behind their
        house. Some of the timber in the shed has been curing for
        years, just waiting for the right customer to come along.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Labourers needed.">
      Gordy has a tree to harvest, his regular labourers are
      unavailable, so he is willing to offer good wages to help
      harvest the tree and get it back to town.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Chance Encounter.">
      The PCs encounter Gordy on one of his explorations; he is
      looking for a tree suitable for making lances. A wealthy Baron
      has contracted with a weaponcrafter for a dozen lances.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Missing.">
      Gordy is a few days overdue from one of his trips. His father,
      an elderly woodcrafter offers a small reward to the PCs if they
      can find him.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="The Suspect.">
      The local lord believes that someone is passing information to
      the bandits living in the forest. Gordy has come under
      suspicion. Rather than arrest him, the lord hires the PCs to
      follow him and find out what he knows about the bandits.

      <p>
        Gerrick is the eldest son and heir to Senator Asarn of
        Tharda. The Asarn family is one of the main landholding
        families of the Coranan District. Gerrick has rarely been
        outside the city of Coranan, preferring its diverse
        entertainment options to the "boredom of the countryside".
        Four family manors provide him with a modest income.
      </p>
      <p>
        A devout worshipper of Halea, Gerrick is a hedonist with
        tastes that others would describe as odd, if they could
        adequately describe them at all. A regular attendant to
        services at the temple, he has made sufficient donations to
        have the services of a priestess living at his residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gerrick maintains a stable of pleasure slaves at a townhouse
        owned through an intermediary; he purchases a new slave two or
        three times a year. He allows his bodyguards use of the slaves
        as well, increasing their loyalty. Slaves that no longer
        please him are sold, usually with their tongues cut out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gerrick is a skilled manipulator, negotiator, blackmailer, and
        money manager. He has an extensive network of contacts
        throughout Coranan, almost all of which owe him favours. These
        contacts are used first for the betterment of Gerrick, and
        then for the betterment of the family, a policy that has not
        endeared him to the rest of the Asarns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gerrick fully believes that he will become Senator Gerrick
        after the passing of his father, an event for which Gerrick is
        becoming impatient.  He is aware that not all of the extended
        family would support him in an election, and is working on
        gathering the information and resources he needs to ensure his
        succession.  Blackmail, extortion, and assassination are just
        methods of negotiation as far as Gerrick is concerned.
      </p>
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="A Favour for a Favour.">
      The PCs are in a bit of trouble; Gerrick helps them, either
      financially or by influence. But the cost will be a favour in
      return.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Abduction.">
      Gerrick has had an NPC (or a PC) abducted to be used as one of
      his pleasure slaves. PCs investigate and either have to rescue
      them, buy them, or negotiate a release.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Information Gathering.">
      In order to further his goals, Gerrick needs some sensitive
      information on someone. He hires or blackmails the PCs to get
      it, but will disavow and eventually silence them if they are
      caught.
    </note>
    <note type="hook" value="Bodyguards.">
      Gerrick has learned that another family member has contracted
      for his death, he needs additional bodyguards, and the PCs fit
      the bill as an expendable resource.

        <em>Chabla, Lady of Paladins, Master of Cundras.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Grief, anger and hatred can make monsters of us all. When he
        was 20, Sir Enyel fathered a child with a young acolyte of
        Larani. Use of family connections kept the affair secret, and
        the child was raised in his brother's household. Sir Enyel
        never acknowledged the child as his, but spent considerable
        time and effort subtly guiding his son's upbringing. As his
        own wealth and power grew, he was able to provide even more
        for his son. Eventually the boy earned his own knighthood
        within the Lady of Paladins, and Sir Enyel saw to it that he
        was stationed at Cundras. In 713TR, Sir Enyel's son was
        assigned to escort a group of missionaries into Solori
        territory, none of them returned alive. And thus, the Solori
        Crusade was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that fateful day, the Grandmaster has stubbornly refused
        to listen to any voice of reason. The strength of his will,
        and the power of his rhetoric and oratory has overcome much
        resistance to the cause.  The massacre of Laranian knights in
        717TR added weight to the Grandmasters words as he used the
        event to whip the order into a frenzy of hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temple at Cundras is in possession of an artefact, a staff
        called the "Light of Alamire". A small lantern affixed to the
        top of the staff is said to have been used by Saint Ambrathas
        himself as he penned the holy texts of the church. It is
        believed that the light of Larani will illuminate the truth to
        any who read by its red tinged light. After the massacre of
        717TR, Sir Enyel had the Cundras copy of the book "Punishing
        the Wicked" chained to the staff. This is the only holy book
        he reads from anymore. The Grandmaster has taken to carrying
        the staff and book into battle, reading aloud from it as he
        extols his troops to ever greater acts of brutality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The health of the grandmaster is deteriorating as his hatred
        for the Solori consumes him. The failure of the Kaldoric
        branch of the Lady of Paladins to send significant support
        furthers his rage. He has never shed a tear for his lost son,
        and until he does the Solori will be the ones shedding
        tears.

        Chosen for their ambition, lack of fear and quick wits,
        Zaurial and Gerrin's squires are as deadly as they are
        young. In addition to their masters, the squires assist the
        other knights as well. They sleep on cots in the main
        hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty-four, <em>Vos Lidtkie</em> has been with Zaurial for
        three years. Of noble birth, his clan was on the losing end
        of a vicious feud. Captured and sold into the Pamesani games
        as a gladiator, he earned his freedom, and the attention of
        Zaurial, by winning eighty-eight straight bouts in three
        years. He can use almost any weapon put in his hand (+20 ML
        to all Combat Skills listed).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sedore Tuer</em> is Zaurial's newest squire, just
        sixteen. The second son of the bailiff of Timrola Manor, his
        family have been loyal servants of Clan Bisidril for
        decades. Sedore hopes to earn his knighthood in combat. A
        fanatic Agrikan, Sedore prefers a mace (ML 81). He is also a
        pyromaniac and definitely a little unstable. The other
        squires keep a close eye on him.
      </p>
      <p>
        A boyishly handsome eighteen, <em>Barton Foley</em> is Sir
        Gerrin's personal squire and lover. An angelic face, blonde
        hair and blue eyes cannot disguise the cold stare of a
        hardened killer. His left hand, lost in combat at age 14,
        has been replaced with a hook. Covered by a leather sheath
        except in combat, he keeps the inner curve razor sharp by
        daily stropping with a honing stone. A plate vambrace
        protects his left arm, leaving his hook free to entrap an
        enemy's sword. In his right he wields a delicate but deadly
        short sword with considerable skill (ML 85).

        Zaurail has also attracted a small group of veteran
        men-at-arms to his service. He accepts only the toughest,
        most skilled fighters into his service, but once accepted,
        he fits them out with little regard to cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sergeant and senior man-at-arms is <em>Lasher</em>. Old
        scar tissue twists his mouth into a slight perpetual sneer
        and he speaks with a foreign accent (possibly Azeryani). He
        refuses to discuss his past, but is an ardent Agrikan. His
        primary weapon is a broadsword (ML 95).
      </p>
      <p>
        After a rival lord wiped out his family, <em>Trotter</em>
        travelled to Golotha to become a man-at-arms. His desire for
        vengeance still burns hot and he often takes it out on
        innocent victims. He uses a combination of axe (ML 90) and
        dagger in a high effective and unique fighting style he
        developed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caught raping his younger sister, <em>Hotch</em> was forced to
        kill his mother and father and flee for his life. Furtive
        and unsavoury, he is stealthy and deadly with a dagger. He
        acts as Zaurial's primary scout. He uses a broadsword or
        spear (ML 90) in combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ja-Jo</em> loves to sing and has a strong deep
        baritone. His habit of chanting Agrikan hymns while fighting
        has thrown off many an opponent. He considers the mace his
        best weapon (ML 90), but he is actually very good with
        broadsword as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most strangers dismiss <em>Slim</em> as little more than a
        scribe, a role he frequently performs for his master since
        he can read and write fluently and speaks six
        languages. Behind his thin intellectual face and lanky frame
        is a vicious, hardened street fighter with unexpected sinewy
        strength. His mild appearance and blinding speed catches
        opponents off guard and unprepared, frequently allowing him
        to strike first with either his dagger or short
        sword.
      </p>
      <p>
        A badly healed sword blow to throat has left <em>Talker</em>
        unable to speak and in constant pain. It is difficult for
        him to eat or drink. Slim is his best friend and is teaching
        him to read and write. A huge man, he wields a heavy steel
        mace (ML 80) with ease. He is the best crossbowman (ML 98)
        in the company.
